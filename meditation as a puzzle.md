# meditation as a puzzle

_previous note:_ [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]

---

The AI researcher and rationalist Eliezer Yudkowsky occasionally inserts a meditation as a form of puzzle into his writing as a means to activate the reader's thinking and attention:

>A 'meditation' is a puzzle that the reader is meant to attempt to solve before continuing. It's my somewhat awkward attempt to reflect the research which shows that you're much more likely to remember a fact or solution if you try to solve the problem yourself before reading the solution; succeed or fail, the important thing is to have tried first .[@yudkowsky_useful_2012 n.p.]

_thoughts & links:_

- not so different from re-membering the body through mindfulness. To call to mind. 
- see also [[zen and don't know mind]] in thinking about being open to change
