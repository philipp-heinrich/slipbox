# somatics is the field which studies the soma

_previous note:_  

---

Thomas Hanna distinguishes between the body as observed from the outside (third-person perspective) and the soma as perceived from the inside (first-person perception). He says that somatics is "the field which studies the _soma_".[@hanna_what_1995 p.341] The term _somatics_ was coined by Hanna in the 1970s "to describe and unify"[@eddy_brief_2009 p.7] various processes which involved "listening deeply to the body."[@eddy_brief_2009 p.6]
