# the skilled performer is responsive

_previous note:_ [[fields of practice]]

---

>The movement of the skilled practitioner, by contrast, is continually and fluently responsive to perturbations of the perceived environment (Ingold 1993a: 462). This is possible because the practitioner's bodily movement is, at one and the same time, a movement of attention; because he watches, listens and feels even as he works. It is this responsiveness that underpins the qualities of care, judgement and dexterity that are the hallmarks of [p.136] skilled workmanship (Pye 1968: 22). As Nicholai Bernstein wrote some fifty years ago, the essence of dexterity lies not in bodily movements themselves but in the 'tuning of the movements to an emergent task', whose surrounding conditions are never precisely the same from one moment to the next (Bernstein 1996: 23, original emphases).[@ingold_transmission_2001 pp.135-136]
