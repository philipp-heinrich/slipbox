Heidegger's concept of enframing -- _gestell_ -- comes from his 1954 book _The Question Concerning Technology_. It refers to the idea that human encounters with things (or resources) in the world are shaped in particular ways that change our relationship with that thing. For example, when we damn a river to produce electricity, the river is enframed as a power source and no longer a river. Heidegger states that enframing is not in itself technological:

>Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.[Heidegger, in @noauthor_gestell_2020]


_questions & thoughts:_

- compare with thinking on the _body of the film_ where we can't see the body of the film but rather what it makes possible
