# instrumental extrinsic value definition

_previous note:_  [[intrinsic value definition]]

---

Something has instrumental or extrinsic value if it is a means to an end (rather than the end itself). This distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic value is a concept in moral philosophy.

The terms instrumental and intrinsic were coined by sociologist Max Weber.


_questions & thoughts:_

- this wikipedia page has fascinating header describing how it is written like a personal essay, and that it only has a Western perspective
- my sense is that understanding the reason we do anything is so fundamental to living full lives
- I have a sense I have this as a zettel as a reminder to understand why I do what I do (and what is driving me), and the pressures that cause me to do things that have instrumental value. I'm not seeking some kind of ideological 'instrinsic' purity here; just noticing.
