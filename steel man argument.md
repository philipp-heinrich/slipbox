# steel man argument

_previous note:_ [[map and territory]]

---

To _strawman_ is to give the appearance of refuting an argument when in fact you are arguing against an entirely different (and often much weaker)  argument. It is the performance of an argument. _Steelmanning_ is when we take the very best version of someone's argument and attempt to refute or argue with that. It is the opposite of strawmanning. It addresses the "best form of the other person’s argument, even if it’s not the one they presented."[Chana Messinger, in @sloan_steel_2014 n.pag.] 

In his Medium post, Robin Sloan describes debates in the [Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/) in which after the first person has made their case the person responding must summarise that person's argument in a way that satisfies the person (and then the same happens in reverse).

- contrast with Godin's [[questioning our beliefs]] or even [[questions while reading]] from Ahren's book
