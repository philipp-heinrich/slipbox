>There are three ways to ask what makes art research distinctive in relation to current academic and scientific research: by posing an ontological, an epistemological and a methodological question. The ontological question is (a): What is the nature of the object, of the subject matter, in research in the arts? To what does the research address itself? And in what respect does it thereby differ from other scholarly or scientific research? The epistemological question is (b): What kinds of knowledge and understanding are embodied in art practice? And how does that knowledge relate to more conventional types of academic knowledge? The methodological question is (c): What research methods and techniques are appropriate to research in the arts? And in what respect do these differ from the methods and techniques in the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities?[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.11]


>We can hence speak of research in the arts only when the practice of art delivers an intended, original contribution to what we know and understand.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.9]

-- the problem is that there are no limits. No one admits to not contributing. Responding to question of how art research is distinctive from current academic research, Borgdorff describes ontological, epistemological and methodological questions. The epistemological question is, "What kinds of knowledge and understanding are embodied in art practice? And how does that knowledge relate to more conventional types of academic knowledge?"[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.11] -- he does a poor job of addressing the question. Whose bodies? (body of researcher? body of the work of art? body of audience?)

- even if method is reflective-analytical (c.f. empirical) doesn't mean that anything goes. But what are grounds for falsifiability? 

>The natural sciences likewise seek to generate exact knowledge that corresponds to universal laws or patterns, but which, contrary to mathematical knowledge, is often obtained by experimental means. These can be contrasted with art history (to cite just one example from the humanities), which is not primarily interested in formulating precise, universal laws, but more in gaining access to the particular and the singular through interpretation. Experimentation plays virtually no role there at all.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.17]

His summary:
>Art practice – both the art object and the creative process – embodies situated, tacit knowledge that can be revealed and articulated by means of experimentation and interpretation.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.18]

- doesn't account for a process or acknowledging the assay point. e.g. I could have a practice, start research, then assay my practice at the beginning and present as research.
