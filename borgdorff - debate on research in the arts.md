# borgdorff - debate on research in the arts

_previous note:_ 

---

An excellent overview of the history of practice-research and its major concerns.

Other notes directly from this article:
- [[object, process and context in practice-research]]
- [[research on, for and in the arts]]

This is Borgdorff's summary of the article:

>Art practice – both the art object and the creative process – embodies situated, tacit knowledge that can be revealed and articulated by means of experimentation and interpretation.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.18]

How does such a summary account for a research _process_ or acknowledge an _assay point_. That is, I might have a practice, start the research, then immediately assay my practice at the beginning to present it as research. 

Responding to question of how art research is distinctive from current academic research, Borgdorff describes ontological, epistemological and methodological questions. The epistemological question is, "What kinds of knowledge and understanding are embodied in art practice? And how does that knowledge relate to more conventional types of academic knowledge?"[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.11] -- he does a poor job of addressing the question. Whose bodies? (body of researcher? body of the work of art? body of audience?) ^e4ce42

>We can hence speak of research in the arts only when the practice of art delivers an intended, original contribution to what we know and understand.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.9]

- the problem is that there are no limits. No one admits to not contributing (but in what branches of research do people ever do this?). 
- even if method is reflective-analytical (c.f. empirical) it shouldn't mean that anything goes. But in either case, what are the grounds for falsifiability? What are the grounds for even being sceptical or doubtful? What would it take to express uncertainty that would bring the practice into question? 

>The natural sciences likewise seek to generate exact knowledge that corresponds to universal laws or patterns, but which, contrary to mathematical knowledge, is often obtained by experimental means. These can be contrasted with art history (to cite just one example from the humanities), which is not primarily interested in formulating precise, universal laws, but more in gaining access to the particular and the singular through interpretation. Experimentation plays virtually no role there at all.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.17]
