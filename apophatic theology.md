# apophatic theology

_previous note:_ [[via negativa]]

---

Apophatic theology is a form of thinking which attempts to approach the nature of God only by negation -- by saying what God is not. It is closely related to _via negativa_. It has a strong presence in mysticism.

Apophatic theology is often paired with _cataphatic theology_ which uses direct language to say what God is.
