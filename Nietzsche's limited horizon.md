# Nietzsche's limited horizon

Here Jeremiah Day is referring to an artwork by his friend Erik Smith who was doing a digging project in Berlin and discovered a staircase leading downwards. Smith was resisting going to the archive to find out what it was and kept on delaying the visit. He was sustaining a period of discovery: 

>I believe that as Smith’s staircase becomes visible it will attract more passers-by, and it will become his, not just the staircase of some former owners. By not knowing the “truth,” Smith’s act can become a kind of “fiction”—back to the root of that word, a shaping of circumstance, the transformation that gives art its own status, claims, and questions. Perhaps Smith’s decision not to go to the archive (yet) is like what Friedrich Nietzsche called the choice of a “limited horizon,” in which not all questions have to be faced, in which one does not need to be responsible to all perspectives, to preserve the space of “becoming.”[p.66]

This is complex and gets straight to the heart of the power and limitations of #practice-research. This kind of ongoing unknowing -- a space of becoming -- is so beautiful and vital but it also seems like only part of the story of what research is for, and why we value it. As if I might understand research to a process that is only ever 0.94, then what Day is describing is <0.94, perhaps closer to 0.68 (more partial).

_thoughts & links:_
 
- It seems to contradict (yes?) Borgdorff in [[art practice and artistic research]] not so much in the 'production of outputs' but in more openly limiting what artistic research does.
- see [[artistic research refers to a method]] for more general summary/overview of this chapter by Day. He's pretty critical of practice-research and kind of wants artists just to be artists.
- seems like a fundamental question that has not really yet been addressed is when am I making art and when am I making art-as-research? I come back to 'context' here. That is, as an artist in the academy it defines my work as artistic-research. But wow this is so passive and a long way from [[biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions]] and their push for recognising values in order to create a new research model
- what context was Nietzsche referring to -- death of God. See here [colinbodayle.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/nietzsche-on-drinking-up-the-sea/](https://colinbodayle.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/nietzsche-on-drinking-up-the-sea/)
