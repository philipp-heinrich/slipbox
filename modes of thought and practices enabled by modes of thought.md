# modes of thought and practices enabled by modes of thought

Adams St. Pierre makes a simple but I suspect very useful distinction between the epistemological and the ontological as follows: 

>epistemological (modes of thought) and the ontological (practices enabled by modes of thought).[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.4]

_thoughts & links:_

- compare with [[critical realism]]
- worth considering in relation to [[schwab - experimental systems]] and my sense that the ontological as described by Adams St Pierre is more akin to an epistemic thing (both of which are driven by practices). But, I suspect they are talking about very different things #practice-research 
- contrast also with Ingold's idea that [[knowing is immanent in the field of practice]]
