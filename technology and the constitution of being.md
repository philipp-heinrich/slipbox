# technology and the constitution of being

Brian Massumi attempts to describe why Simondon's work became increasingly relevant across science and humanities and social sciences, and in particular how technology has played a critical role in the overlap of these "opposing camps"[@massumi-2009-technical p.37]

>The question of technology was now directly a question of the constitution of being--in a word, ontology. Or more precisely: because given the juncture, the question of being had to be approached from the angle of becoming; it was a question of ontogenesis. The ontogenesis at issue was constitutively entangled with modes of knowledge and their associated practices, so the problem was as directly epistemological as it was ontological.[@massumi-2009-technical p.37]
