# object, process and context in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts]]

---

Borgdorff suggests that it is "fruitful"[p.8] in artistic research to distinguish between object, process and context. 

_Object_ is the work of art. _Process_ is the making of art. _Context_ is the art world. 

He makes a point about assessment in practice-research:

>Especially in the assessing (and funding) of research in the arts, it makes quite some difference whether one exclusively examines the results in the form of concrete art objects, or whether one also looks at the documentation of the process that has led to those results or at the context which is partially constitutive of the meaning of both the object and the process.[p.9]

_questions & thoughts:_

- useful to consider the balance of these three simple distinctions in any #practice-research project
