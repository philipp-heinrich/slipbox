# godin - dancing with belief

_previous note:_ 

---

Seth Godin is a writer, teacher and internet lord. _Dancing with belief_ is a blog post about our beliefs, and the simple idea that all of us believe things that are inconsistent with how the world is, and what others think.

Godin suggests five questions to ask of our beliefs:

1. Is it working?
2. Is it helpful?
3. Is it true?
4. Do you need it to be true?
5. What would change your mind?
