# godin - dancing with belief

_previous note:_ 

---

Seth Godin is a writer, teacher and internet lord. _Dancing with belief_ is a blog post about our beliefs, and the simple idea that all of us believe things that are inconsistent with how the world is, and what others think.

Godin suggests five questions to ask of our beliefs:

_1. Is it working?_
If a belief is working for you and not causing other people harm, then go for it. Beliefs aren't about accurate representations of the world, but "almost always about community, about being part of something."[@godin_dancing_2020 n.pag.]

_2. Is it helpful?_
If a belief is getting in the way of something (work, life, friendships, community) then it's worth interrogating how you got them and why you have them.

_3. Is it true?_
Is there evidence for the truth of the belief? Is it able to be falsified? If there's evidence that it's true (or false) then it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.

_4. Do you need it to be true?_
Don't waste time proving beliefs are true. That's not the point of beliefs. They might be to reassure us, help us recover, etc. The danger is when our beliefs interfere with doing things, helping others, etc. Such beliefs are easily manipulable by others. ^b413a8

_5. What would change your mind?_
What would happen to you if you come to realise your belief is not true? Do you replace it with another belief (what Godin calls a "layer of insulation")?

_thoughts & links:_

- [[map and territory]]
- [[the map is not the territory]]
- the last two questions appeal to me enormously. They are a challenge to our assumptions about the world and the ways in which we construct that world to make us feel ... safe? 
- what do I believe in, why do I need to believe in it and what would it take for me to change my mind? 
- they are questions about what we have invested in something and why. 
- in some respects I imagine the questions to be somewhat terrifying as well
