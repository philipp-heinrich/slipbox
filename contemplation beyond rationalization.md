# contemplation beyond rationalization

_previous note:_ [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]]

---
The focus of Kerr's writing about Merton and Borgmann is the nature of contemplation in a technologically-driven age. His definition of contemplation is worth quoting at length:

>The word contemplation is a compound word, literally translated as “with an open space.” It can mean to think or observe with an open space, a space marked in the sky, a temple -- to think with the heavens. The way of contemplation, the intentionality of contemporary forays into its orbit, brings with it these two derived metaphors from the Latin compound: contemplation involves openness and ultimacy. The vitality of contemplation for both Merton and Borgmann is the conjunction, “with” (con). To think with God is the classical province of contemplation, but for Borgmann and the later Merton to be with others in a contiguous arrangement or relation resulting in deepened awareness of self and the world is also contemplative being-with. Merton and Borgmann share a concern about the deterioration and possibility of contemplation in a constantly changing culture conditioned by technology. [@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.58]

Kerr describes how Merton suggests that contemplation can neither be taught nor clearly explained. It "can only be hinted at, suggested, pointed to, symbolized"[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.64] The more we attempt to make sense of contemplation (through analysis and science for example) the further it slips beyond reach of "verbalization and of rationalization."[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.64]

- [[without symbolic mediation]]

- the idea that contemplation can't be rationalized reminded me of Riskin's statement that [[interpretation remains present]] at every level.
- thinking about authentic movement and what feels like a primary or contemplative experience of reality, or [[the really real]] #finger-pointing-moon
