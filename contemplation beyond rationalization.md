# contemplation beyond rationalization

_previous note:_ [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]]

---
The focus of Kerr's writing about Merton and Borgmann is the nature of contemplation in a technologically-driven age. His definition of contemplation is worth quoting at length:

>The word contemplation is a compound word, literally translated as “with an open space.” It can mean to think or observe with an open space, a space marked in the sky, a temple -- to think with the heavens. The way of contemplation, the intentionality of contemporary forays into its orbit, brings with it these two derived metaphors from the Latin compound: contemplation involves openness and ultimacy. The vitality of contemplation for both Merton and Borgmann is the conjunction, “with” (con). To think with God is the classical province of contemplation, but for Borgmann and the later Merton to be with others in a contiguous arrangement or relation resulting in deepened awareness of self and the world is also contemplative being-with. Merton and Borgmann share a concern about the deterioration and possibility of contemplation in a constantly changing culture conditioned by technology. [@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.58]

Kerr describes how Merton suggests that contemplation can neither be taught nor clearly explained. It "can only be hinted at, suggested, pointed to, symbolized"[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.64] -- can't be rationalized (links to Popper in Riskin -- everything is interpretation)

>Merton says: “For Contemplation cannot be taught. It cannot even be clearly explained. It can only be hinted at, suggested, pointed to, symbolized. The more objectively and scientifically one tries to analyze it, the more he empties it of its real content, for this experience is beyond the reach of verbalization and of rationalization.”14
>Though it cannot be defined (as the philosopher would like) it can be reflected upon and considered—even though Merton suggests the experience of contemplation is beyond verbalization and rationalization, that does not stop him from trying to describe aspects, dimensions, or what contemplation is not.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.64]
- see footnote re via negativa -- create note about this? 

his summary of the nature of contemplation (and what it is not) needs its own note. Links to authentic movement I'd say. "The really real"?? pp.64-66 (Mumford's book mentions this?)
