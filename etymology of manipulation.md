# etymology of manipulation


Thinking about the [[etymology of technology]] and Jacobs' thinking about the [[mythical vs technological core of culture]] and it's hard not to consider the etymology of the word _manipulation_. That is, technology and manipulation go (ahem) hand in hand. The word's Latin origins are to "fill hands" or "handful". Its use moved to the capacity to handle objects, and then the "'handling or managing of persons,'' especially to one's own advantage."[@noauthor-nodate-manipulation n.p.]
