# radical empiricism

Radical empiricism is a philosophical doctrine set out by Williams James in _The Meaning of Truth_:

>It asserts that experience includes both particulars and relations between those particulars, and that therefore both deserve a place in our explanations. In concrete terms: Any philosophical worldview is flawed if it stops at the physical level and fails to explain how meaning, values and intentionality can arise from that.[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_empiricism)
