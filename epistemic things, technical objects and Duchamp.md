# epistemic things, technical objects and Duchamp

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experiment]]

---

In _Experiment!_ Michael Schwab uses Duchamp's _Fountain_[-@duchamp_fountain_1917] as the first example of an artwork that treated art itself as a Rheinbergian experimental system:

>Duchamp manipulated the conditions (a set of objects called ‘art’ that defined what was deemed possible: Rheinberger’s ‘technical objects’) in such a way that _Fountain_ (an object initially seen as outside art: Rheinberger’s ‘epistemic thing’) required the whole system (‘art’) to change should its existence as art object be acknowledged.[schwab_experiment_2015 p.126]

However, Schwab suggests that the lack of "material practice"[schwab_experiment_2015 p.127] and by approaching art as "a set of functional relations"[p.127] (as opposed to material ones) the loss of the original material object is unimportant. According to Schwab, this makes his attempt to mirror art practice-research (and experimentation) with Rheinberger's theorisation of experimentation less strong.

_thoughts & links:_

- [[epistemic things and technical objects]]
- [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]]

- I'm not sure I fully understand the implications regarding material practice. It seems to be a rather arbitrary line -- between material and functional practices -- as if a conceptually driven practice can't be _held_ by the conditions of practice-research. Or that such a practice is not beholden to understandings of iteration, change, development, observation. But, again, I'm not sure I understand Schwab clearly enough here
