# scrivener - transformational practice

_previous note:_ 

---

Stephen Scrivener's chapter in the Biggs and Karlsson edited volume is called  _Transformational Practice: On The Place Of Material Novelty In Artistic Change_. In it Scrivener attempts to tackle the seemingly vexed question of whether art "embodies a research function."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260] His concern is that the question has been colonised (or restricted) by "funding bodies and the like"[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.259] such that the context for the debate has determined or _caused_ the debate itself. In response, Scrivener attempts to redefine the question by comparing the presence of transformational practices in art to Kuhnian paradigm shifts "since such renewals appear to be contingent on the production of new knowledge".[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

>Jacques Rancière’s theory of art will be drawn on in which art is understood as a bond between image and text, or image and ideas. Under this theory, the critic’s contribution to artistic renewal will be examined before considering the more challenging question, in the context of art and research, of how the material innovations of the artist contribute to change in understanding of art. It will be argued that historically, at least, cognitive surprise can be understood as the primary mechanism responsible for the cognition of material innovation and the activation of its consequences. To illustrate this proposition, the art of the late eighteenth-century english landscape painter, John Constable, will be discussed as a model of the research function in art, since it contributed to a new understanding of art and to its renewal.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

>Rancière makes the claim that art’s existence relies on the weaving of relations between practices of making, seeing, saying and thinking. ... [these relations] are constructed, dismantled and reconstructed according to changing ambition, need and interest ...[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.262-263]

Scrivener cites Rancière's conception of the relationship between words and images to claim that "a bond has to be formed between words and images in order for there to be art."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.264]

Discusses how the concept and experience of surprise:

>generates curiosity by informing the conscious self about the occurrence of a schema discrepancy. since this information concerns one’s belief system it involves a meta- cognitive process: cognition about cognition or knowing about knowing.[p.264]

"Hence, one way that an art work can be instrumental in changing understanding of art is by engendering surprise."[p.264]

>it is suggested that, recognizing this fact, toward the end of his life Constable sought to articulate a way of seeing his paintings as conjunctive, rather than disjunctive.[p.265]
- really interested in this -- in a way one of chief concerns is that practice-research is almost entirely disjunctive (akin to Constable in Scrivener's thinking). 

>Constable was advocating that if the artist is to see, then the artist must know: to know, the artist should acquire scientific understanding of nature and its effects, and, guided by a scientific method of observation, apply that understanding in poetic interpretation.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.267]
- reminded here of my ambition in #finger-pointing-moon -- embracing empirical analysis in to open up new poetic, imagistic and discursive possibilities 

Scrivener describes how Constable through his lectures "provides not an explanation, not a critique, not an assessment of his work, but a conceptual scaffold for its reception and appreciation."[p.270] Utterly fascinating.

This writing is really -- it seems to me -- a way of arguing for writing about artistic research such that we explicate how art is changed by the work we have made.

_thoughts & links:_

- tight relationship to [[noë - strange tools]] and [[art is bad design on purpose]]; e.g. on p.261 Scrivener mentions the art work of Stubbs and Constable, and says that their "primary contribution" was to "art fact and art discourse."
- Scrivener discusses Frayling's conception of [[research on, for and in the arts]] on p.261.
- [[a case for writing in practice-research]] -- see pp 263 and 264 in relation to Rancière
