# scrivener - transformational practice

_previous note:_

Stephen Scrivener's chapter in the Biggs and Karlsson edited volume is called  _Transformational Practice: On The Place Of Material Novelty In Artistic Change_. In it Scrivener attempts to tackle the seemingly vexed question of whether art "embodies a research function."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260] His concern is that the question has been colonised (or restricted) by "funding bodies and the like"[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.259] such that the context for the debate has determined or _caused_ the debate itself. In response, Scrivener attempts to redefine the question by comparing the presence of transformational practices in art to Kuhnian paradigm shifts:

>to investigate whether art embodies a research function, let’s ask whether art practice undergoes Kuhnian paradigm shifts, since such renewals appear to be contingent on the production of new knowledge.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

>Jacques Rancière’s theory of art will be drawn on in which art is understood as a bond between image and text, or image and ideas. under this theory, the critic’s contribution to artistic renewal will be examined before considering the more challenging question, in the context of art and research, of how the material innovations of the artist contribute to change in understanding of art. it will be argued that historically, at least, cognitive surprise can be understood as the primary mechanism responsible for the cognition of material innovation and the activation of its consequences. To illustrate this proposition, the art of the late eighteenth-century english landscape painter, John Constable, will be discussed as a model of the research function in art, since it contributed to a new understanding of art and to its renewal.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

>Rancière makes the claim that art’s existence relies on the weaving of relations between practices of making, seeing, saying and thinking. ... [these relations] are constructed, dismantled and reconstructed according to changing ambition, need and interest.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.262]
