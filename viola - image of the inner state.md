# viola - image of the inner state

_previous note:_ 

---

>My interest in the various image systems of the world involves a search for the image that is not an image. This is why I am not interested in 'realisticâ€™ rendering. Sacred art seems very close because of its symbolic nature. I am interested not so much in the image whose source lies in the phenomenal world, but rather the image as artefact, or result, or imprint, or even wholly determined by some inner realisation. It is the image of that inner state and as such must be considered completely accurate and realistic.

-- Bill Viola, 1981
