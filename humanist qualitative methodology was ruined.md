# humanist qualitative methodology was ruined


>But I was certainly not the only one deconstructing concepts that structure and organize conventional humanist qualitative methodology in the early 1990s. Lather (1993) and Scheurich (1993) deconstructed validity. Scheurich (1995) deconstructed the interview. In history, Scott (1991) deconstructed experience. Nespor and Barylske (1991) deconstructed narrative; and Visweswaran (1994) and Britzman (1995) deconstructed ethnography. Later, Lather (2000) deconstructed empathy, voice, and authenticity; Jackson (2003) deconstructed voice; and Pillow (2003) deconstructed reflexivity. By then, humanist qualitative methodology was, indeed, ruined.[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.8]
