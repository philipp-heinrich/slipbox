# artefacts and writing in PaR

_previous note:_ [[knowledge verified and challenged]]

---

Candy and Edmond make some broad statements about the need for a written component in practice-research (and not only in the context of PhDs):

>Awarding PhDs for practice-based research is not often justified solely by the making of works. Research includes the production of some kind of description of what is new, or what has been discovered or created. Practice-based art research can be about the creation of new apprehensions but any art object made as part of that research does not, by itself, embody knowledge. However, the text that accompanies the work may indeed illuminate new apprehensions or a new way of creating apprehensions that we can claim as the new knowledge produced.[@candy_role_2010 p.121]


_questions & thoughts:_

- fascinating the wording of "embody knowledge", as if it 'contains' the knowledge
- the limits of the word _description_ are equally fascinating; as if we merely describe the _new knowledge_
- it's hard to read this text -- 10 years after it was published -- and to note how little we have travelled even since then
- noting also their use of the word 'apprehensions' like Scrivener (who they cite on p.124)
- there is more in their chapter about the role of the writing as 'context'

- #practice-research 
- [[a case for writing in practice-research]]
- #finger-pointing-moon 
- [[gadamer and understanding as an event]]
