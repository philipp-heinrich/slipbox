# technics. techne, and technology

 
 >I make a distinction between the use of the words technics. techne, and technology: technics refers to the general category of all forms of making and practice; techne refers to the Greek conception of it. which Heidegger understands aspoiesis or bringing forth; and technology refers to a radical turn which took place during European modernity, and developed in the direction of ever-increasing automation, leading consequently to what Heidegger calls the Gestell.[@hui-2016-question p.4]
