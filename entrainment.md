# entrainment

The OED contains various understandings/uses of entrainment:

1. Enthusiasm, liveliness; impulsiveness (now rare)
2. 
	a. The drawing in and carrying along or away of a substance, particles, etc., by the flow of a fluid.
	b. The absorption, drawing in, or entrapment of one substance by another.
	c. _Chemistry_. In distillation: the separation of one or more components of an azeotropic mixture by the addition of a substance with which they form a new azeotrope.
	d. _Meteorology_. The mixing of surrounding air into a cloud; (also) the drawing of air from a non-turbulent air flow into a turbulent one.
3. The synchronizing of a rhythmic or oscillatory phenomenon or process with another with which it interacts

_thoughts & links:_

- Each of the definitions is rich in how it asks us to consider influence in general, and Sennett's idea that [[a border is not a boundary]]. 
- powerful metaphor for [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]] and even heterodoxy in [[doxa and habitus#^6db9e6]] and also the potency of disorder in that same zettel
- in [[the skilled performer is responsive]] Ingold's use of "perturbation of the perceived environment" acknowledges the fluidity of the space between the practitioner and their environment. Entrainment -- particularly in relation to chemistry and meteorology -- is a powerful metaphor indeed: fluid, motion-ful, influence.
