# somatic turn in human computer interaction

Interaction technologists Lian Loke and Thecla Schiphorst present an overview of somatic practices in relation to HCI development.[@loke_somatic_2018] They describe how the "somatic turn" has started to influence interactive design and HCI thinking and practices. They suggest that somatic practices and HCI share a common goal to "transform the world from its current state to a preferred state".[@loke_somatic_2018 p.55]

They describe the ways in which technologies are playing a part in personal skill acquisition, or what they describe as "skills of experience"[p.56] Their key idea is that "valuing subjective, first-person perception"[p.57] can reveal "layers of lived experience"[p.57] and thereby develop more nuanced HCI and interaction design.


_questions & thoughts:_

- this is a really useful (and brief) summary of somatic practices and how it might relate to HCI and interaction design
- it's written with HCI people in mind (i.e. people who are not experts in somatic practices)
