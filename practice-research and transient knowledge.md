# practice-research and transient knowledge

_previous note:_ 

---


>Additionally, we may also have to admit that some forms of knowl- edge are context-specific, but that, nevertheless, some kind of knowledge-exchange (modification/realization) has taken place, which is of benefit to the discipline as a whole (in the way individuals or groups might produce new work, talk, write, experience performance etc.). This is one of the challenges that PaR presents to the ‘academy’. Must, then, PaR practitioners articulate their activities in a manner which the acad- emy finds acceptable (conventional, accessible)? Rye - p.164

>... we feel that the academy should be more alive to the epistemological challenge that the idea of PaR presents _per se_ and therefore able to create models and practices which can acknowledge and value the transient types of knowledge which it perhaps creates?[Rye, in @thomson_practice_2003 p.165]


>I don’t really understand what Caroline Rye means by ‘context-specific’ knowledge -- knowledge that can’t be articulated outside of an ‘action/context’. Surely all knowledge can be symbolized. (The symbol isn’t ‘the thing itself’ of course, so there’s always a gap, a fissure, there.) I can, however, grasp the idea that in order to understand something one might have to ‘do it’.[Chamberlain, in @thomson_practice_2003 p.166]
