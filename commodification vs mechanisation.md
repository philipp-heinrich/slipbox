# commodification vs mechanisation

_previous note:_ [[kerr - borgmann on merton]]

---

Kerr cites Borgmann's _Contemplation in a Technological Era: Learning from Thomas Merton_ and the idea of an emerging pattern of technology (as suggested by Merton). Kerr writes that Borgmann builds on Merton's thinking by suggesting "two cultural side effects"[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.71] of these patterns: _commodification_ and _mechanization_.

>Commodification is the detachment of things and practices from their traditional contexts, and the conversion of things and practices into freely available commodities.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.71]

>Mechanization is the replacement of traditions, contexts, and competencies by increasingly powerful and concealed machineries.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.71]
