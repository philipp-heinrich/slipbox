# somatic processes

_previous note:_  [[characteristics of somatics in HCI and interaction design]]

---

Loke and Schiphorst recognise that somatic practices provide the skills to interrogate one's own physical habits and patterns of movement. Indeed, they suggest that one of its key processes is about using tasks and information to interrupt habits or create unfamiliar physical circumstances for the body. Feldenkrais's Awareness Through Movements practice is a precise example of an attempt to re-organise or reconfigure the sensory-motor neural pathways of the body.
