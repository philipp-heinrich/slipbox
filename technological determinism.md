# technological determinism 

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. The _problem_ is seen everywhere. 

In _Present Shock_, Douglas Rushkoff suggests we should focus on how we change ourselves: 

>The things we use do change us. In order to understand and contend with present shock, we should probably be less immediately concerned with the cause-and-effect consequences of digital activity than with the greater implications and requirements of living in the digital environment. Itâ€™s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]

Consider technological determinism in relation to [[gestell and enframing]] and [[device paradigm and focal things]]. Focal things in particular seem to resist technological determinism.
