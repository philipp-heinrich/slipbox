# propositions, judgement and truth

_previous note:_ [[art is bad design on purpose]]

---

In philosophy, a proposition is a statement that is able to be true or false. In _Process and Reality_ the speculative philosopher Alfred North Whitehead expresses concern that some philosophers "fail to distinguish propositions from judgements."[@whitehead_process_1985 p.259] He then states that "in the real world it is more important that a proposition be interesting than that it be true. The importance of truth is that it adds to interest."[p.259]

What is important here is to separate propositions from judgements. Propositions "pave the way along which the world advances into novelty. Error is the price which we pay for progress."[p.187]

- I don't know enough of this philosphy (indeed, I don't really know any of it) but my suspicion is that most (if not all) #practice-research  is based on propositions that become judgements. That we (systemically) seem incapable of staying with the potential truth and falsity of a proposition
- in a way, my sense is that a proposition being false would add interest in my field
