# inquiry is not thinkable without the knowing subject

>To think and live new modes of being we might follow Foucault and practice a critical ontology of ourselves and refuse that mode of being, even, perhaps, the “new knowing subject” [p.14] (Braidotti, 2013, p. 159) of posthumanism. But who wants to do that? Who can do it? And here it becomes very difficult to think inquiry once one tries to shift to the ontological. Do we continue to inquire as we have and simply ask ontological in addition to epistemological questions—add ontology and stir—as if ontology is not always already there? Do we simply substitute ontological for epistemological questions in the same old enclosure, as if ontology and epistemology can be separated? Can we use futural concepts as methods to break open that structure? Can we develop a new ethos? If we did, how would we get on, live, “be” in a world so overcoded with the being of humanism? What might we do, we researchers? How might we inquire? What kinds of inquiry might be thinkable in different modes of being, different ontologies?
>Would we inquire? Is inquiry thinkable without the knowing subject?[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief pp.14-15]

- her next paragraph -- about the I and the self -- touches on key concepts for fpm. Of the absence of self, of non-judgement. Well, key concepts for understanding authentic movement
- indeed last page is amazing, and at the same leaves me wondering what we might get from such a seemingly nihilistic positioning of research. I suspect there's a balance here: between what is there and what is not. Between what is imagined and what is observed. That we are all making things up all of the time, and we are all attempting to see things as they are. 
- curious paradox of seeking to avoid self-judgement, but in the midst of a critical ontology of our selves -- and what might come to be known through these selves. (see p.15)
