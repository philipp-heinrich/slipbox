# specialist and generalist audience in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

 audience -- this specialist and generalist part is quite brilliant. So clear and simple (see 2nd venn diagram)
- _Finger Pointing Moon_ is really addressing 2, but also to a certain extent 3. It's honing in on 2


>This argument would therefore indicate that PbR is a subset of academic research rather than being a different kind of research all together. As such, it is inextricably bound to practices and transferable concepts from the academic world of knowledge generation and management, and not infinitely renegotiable by practitioners. (p.12)

- I love this last sentence -- that is what is going on (or not at all) -- ie some split between everything and nothing


>This iterative procedure is necessary if we are to make a claim for the potential of non-linguistic communication in academic research in creative areas that is recognized beyond the creative areas. In order for research in CCI to be acknowledged, it is necessary to consider and adhere to the demands of the larger academic community. (p.15)

- this is a useful idea for _Finger Pointing Moon_ -- that the project is in part about larger academic community. Could I do this? This is kind of a big big ambition ...
