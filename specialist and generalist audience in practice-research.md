# specialist and generalist audience in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

---

Biggs and Büchler state that the audience "provides the rationale for deciding whether a question, an answer and a method are relevant."[@biggs_eight_2008 p.11] They recognise how this statement supports an _anything goes_ approach to practice-research: "particular communities could describe and define what constitutes research for themselves"[@biggs_eight_2008 p.11]

In response, Biggs and Büchler propose that there are two audiences for research: i) a general academic audience that is familiar with the underlying principles -- or "necessary conditions"[@biggs_eight_2008 p.10] -- of scholarly research: methods, questions and findings [[connection between question, answer and method]]; ii) a specialised academic audience for the research who "will decide about relevance and appropriateness of the question and method and so on".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.11]

Biggs and Büchler illustrate these relationships in a simple venn diagram:

The critical aspect of the diagram is that the specialised audience is a complete subset of the general audience. This means that, according to Biggs and Büchler, the relevance and appropriateness of the research method, questions, etc as determined by the specialised audience, is also in necessary dialogue with the principles and traditions of the general audience.

>This shows that the specialist audience [...] are not in a position to decide definitions unilaterally. Although there may be a specialist interpretation and topics of interest in the smaller box that other people do not necessarily share, people from the outside, from the academic community at large, are entitled to criticize what that specialist audience is, and is not, validating as ‘research’.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.12]

The interplay or interrelationship between specialised and general audiences is at the heart of Biggs and Büchler's _Situation Position_, as compared with the _Isolationist Position_ (see page 6 for more information). It also means that they understand practice-research to be a "subset of academic research rather than being a different kind of research all together".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.12] Practice-research is "inextricably bound to practices and transferable concepts from the academic world of knowledge generation and management, and not infinitely renegotiable by practitioners".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.12]

_thoughts & links:_

- in #finger-pointing-moon it's useful to recognise that that project is part of a large academic community. That my work is -- at least in part -- to reach out to other disciplines. This is ambitious. B&B say this:

>This iterative procedure is necessary if we are to make a claim for the potential of non-linguistic communication in academic research in creative areas that is recognized beyond the creative areas. In order for research in CCI to be acknowledged, it is necessary to consider and adhere to the demands of the larger academic community.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.15]
