Feelings underpin all difficult conversations, and it's nearly impossible to ignore them. Unless we are dealing with those feelings they will keep coming back and keep reinserting themselves into any conversation.

>difficult conversations do not just involve feelings, they are at their very core about feelings.[@stone_difficult_2003 p.13]

_questions & thoughts:_

- I wonder to what extent feelings are present in _normal_ (non-difficult) conversations?
- I ought to look at what kinds of feelings they are talking about
- am reminded of this emotion wheel: <https://www.skellis.net/blog/emotions>
- there's a link here to somatic practices and sensitising the body to direct sensation and experience
- note that this is the first zettel that I used the 'previous note' system as a branch (ie not simply the previous note that was constructred). Feels like falling into a wormhole.
