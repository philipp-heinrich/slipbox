# mesearch

_previous note:_ [[interpretation remains present]]

---

In an article about _mesearch_ for the Times Higher Education, the english and gender studies scholar Emma Rees writes that the term refers to a type of auto-ethnography in which the research "comes to inscribe itself into us".[@rees_self-reflective_2019 n.p.] 

The tone of the writing is positive. That is, Rees is suggesting that _mesearch_ is, by and large, an important and good thing for the academy in situations in which the life of a research is intimately bound to their research.

_questions & thoughts:_

- I am both _guilty_ of mesearch, and sceptical
- really need to know more about it in relation to auto-ethnography
- I don't have particular issues with mesearch, but more that it (at least in practice-research) seems to drive research bubbles, and an almost total disengagement with the work of other practitioners

_consider:_

- [[assumptions of uniformity]]
- [[gadamer and understanding as an event]]
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
- [[seeing as exchange with the world]] -- if seeing is such an exchange, why wouldn't research be as well? That the boundaries of the self, and how our selves are in relation to the (scholarly) world, comprise personal (or individual?) scholarly work 
- [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]]
