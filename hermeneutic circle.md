Hermeneutics is from the Greek for interpret or translate. It is the theory and methodology of interpretation, particularly in relation to religious or philsophical texts. Some key players were Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger and Gadamas.

>Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.[^1]

Gadamer's thinking maps onto the idea of the hermeneutic circle in which understanding is developed by circling through the parts of a text in relation to the whole, and through the whole of the text in relation to the parts.
