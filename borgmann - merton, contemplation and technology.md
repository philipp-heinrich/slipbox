_previous note:_ 

---

Albert Borgmann is a professor of philosophy at the University of Montana. He specialises in writing about the philosophy of society, culture and technology. 

This article, published in _Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith_ examines the thinking and work of trappist monk [Thomas Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Merton) regarding contemplation and technology.  

>The crucial feature of the technological culture is the insertion of machinery between humanity and reality.[@borgmann_contemplation_2012 p.4]

(compare this quote with Jacobs in [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]) - role of tech. Also, of course, with [[device paradigm and focal things]] and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]

>And thus the pattern of technology becomes visible in its stark and general two-sidedness of commodification and mechanization. Commodifica- tion is the detachment of things and practices from their traditional contexts, and it is the conversion of things and practices into freely available com- modities. Mechanization is the replacement of tradi- tional contexts and competencies by increasingly powerful and concealed machineries. As workers we indenture ourselves for the requirements of the machinery. As consumers we revel in the abundance of unencumbered pleasures.[p.5]

>These schematic accounts of technology and contempla- tion suggest a ready way of connecting them, or rather, of seeing them disconnected. The active and the pleasurable lives line up with machinery and commodity, with production and consumption, with labor and leisure. But contemplation, whether Aris- totelian or Thomist, seems to have no place in the culture of technology and constitutes, if anything, a rebuke to technology. But how can we get beneath such schemata to the real challenges of the day?[p.5]

>Technology, as we think of it here, is the character of the modern era. It surfaces most clearly in research and develop- ment, in industry and commerce, and in appliances and utilities. But technology exerts its power not only in what it does and enables, but also in what it abandons and disables ...[p.5]
