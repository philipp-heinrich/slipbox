# relativism

_previous note:_ [[rationality and what is likely]]

---

Relativism is the idea that truth is dependent on context:

>that truth and falsity, right and wrong, standards of reasoning, and procedures of justification are products of differing conventions and frameworks of assessment and that their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them.[@baghramian_relativism_2015 n.p.] 

This will particularly be the case in highly abstract scenarios in which the properties of something (e.g how beautiful an art work is) is only _relative_ to a given framework of assessment (e.g. cultural norms).

Important relativists (of the _Relativism by Contrast_ variety) are Richard Rorty and Jacques Derrida:

>What justifies the appellation “relativist”, rather than “skeptic”, is not only these philosophers’ suspicion of the possibility of objectivity but their insistence on the role of socio-historical, psychological and textual contexts in accounts of “truth” and “knowledge” claims.[@baghramian_relativism_2015 n.p.]
