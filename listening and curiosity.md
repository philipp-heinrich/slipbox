# listening and curiosity

_previous note:_  [[senses united by action]]

---

Kate Murphy is a journalist and her book _You’re Not Listening: What You’re Missing and Why it Matters_ is certainly not a scholarly text. She does describe a lot of research in and about listening and I was really struck by the simple idea that listening requires curiosity. She cites the American author, broadcaster and historian Studs Terkel who simply said: "The obvious tool of my trade is the tape recorder ... But I suppose the real tool is curiosity."[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 3 n.p.] Murphy writes that curiosity is dampened or diminished when we think we know how a conversation is going to go, and this in turn disrupts our capacity to listen. 


_questions & thoughts:_

- there's a link here with scanning and listening to the body, and the kinds of curiosity that we develop as we are doing that work. And of course with authentic movement

_consider:_ 

- [[art biography autobiography and truth]] -- regarding not knowing (or assuming we know)
- [[preconceptions and the hermeneutic circle]] -- re what is known and unknown
- [[shifting focus and scanning]]
