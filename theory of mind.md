>Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, intents, desires, emotions and knowledge, among others, to oneself and to others. Theory of mind is necessary to understanding that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.[@noauthor_theory_2020 n.p.]

Theory of mind is pivotal to conversation.

Note also the key false-belief test/task by Wimmer and Perner (1983) called [The Sally-Anne task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test). The task reveals the capacity for someone else to hold a false-belief.

On Ryan Murphy's site _Fulcra_, in his post about Theory of Mind -- <https://fulcra.design/conversations-cybernetics-and-theory-of-mind> -- Murphy describes how a Theory of Mind underpins a "good conversation [that] ... follows a cycle of exchange, rethinking, change, and exchange."[@murphy_conversations_2020 n.p.]

_thoughts & links:_

- compare with _Difficult Conversations_ and the idea that we can never know someone else's intentions.
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[direct experience through the senses]]
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
