# interpretation remains present

_previous note:_

>This is not to deny, of course, that the sciences include procedures of observation, controlled experimentation, and analysis, and that these procedures are crucial to the progress of scientific understanding. But no list of four or five discrete steps can describe them, and they don’t operate the way Peirce and the others suggested, carrying the scientist inexorably toward transcendent truth. Interpretation remains present at every level. Everything we know is known by us; we can’t eliminate ourselves from the picture. Defining methods, choosing which ones to use, deciding how to use them, understanding what they produce: each of these acts is fundamentally interpretive.

To say so is not to be a radical relativist: Karl Popper, scourge of relativism, whose theory of falsifiability came to dominate discussion of the scientific method in the middle decades of the twentieth century, emphasized this very point. “Out of uninterpreted sense-experiences science cannot be distilled, no matter how industriously we gather and sort them,” Popper wrote in 1935. “Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her.”

Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg made similar points when laying out their interpretation of quantum mechanics. Bohr reflected that any observation involves an interference with the thing observed. Our own acts of observation are a part of the world we see: we are “both onlookers and actors in the great drama of existence.” Heisenberg elaborated the idea by emphasizing that “what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning,” and that science was therefore “a part of the interplay between nature and ourselves.” Scientists in this period were recognizing the necessity of interpretation and putting that recognition to work in radical new ways that were neither humanistic nor scientific but integrally both. Meanwhile “the scientific method” continued in pursuit of its manifest destiny.

Little wonder that Stanford students have traditionally divided themselves into Techies and Fuzzies; their institution was founded on the divorce between the two. Reading Cowles in my office at Stanford, I understood with new clarity that Silicon Valley is the logical extreme of the Baconian program as Youmans et al. reconstrued it in the late nineteenth century.

Snow’s idea that engineers would solve the world’s problems specifically by not reading Shakespeare, i.e., by devoting themselves single-mindedly to inventing industries to generate wealth, has since become so commonplace that we express it in a single word: “Innovation.” Definitively lost, between Whewell and Snow—or rather, vigorously shouted down—was just the idea that the title of Snow’s “Two Cultures” lecture seems to promote: that Shakespeare and the sciences might be jointly relevant to one project of understanding.
