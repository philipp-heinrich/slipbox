# empirical 

>The dominant way of knowing in the academy is that of empirical observation and critical analysis from a distanced perspective: ‘knowing that’ and ‘knowing about’. This is a view from above the object of inquiry: knowledge that is anchored in paradigm and secured in print. This propositional knowledge is shadowed by another way of knowing that is grounded in active, intimate, hands-on participation and personal connection: ‘knowing how’ and ‘knowing who’. This is a view from ground level, in the thick of things. This is knowledge that is anchored in practice and circulated within a performance community, but is ephemeral. (Conquergood, 2002, p. 146)

- note how Conquergood conflates empirical with distance; contrast with [[radical empiricism]]
