# epistemic things and technical objects

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experimental systems]]

---

Michael Schwab describes _epistemic things_ and _technical objects_ as follows:

>An epistemic thing appears as an as (yet) unknown material trace in an experimental system, which over time as it is increasingly understood is rendered into what Rheinberger calls a technical object, that is, a blackboxed, functional unit ready to be deployed either in future experimental systems or the marketplace.[@schwab_experimental_2019 pp.162-163]

Schwab discusses how Rheinberger considers that the epistemic potential of a _thing_ is reduced as that thing comes to be known or closer to being a technical object. It is also possible for a technical object to be re-rendered as an epistemic thing "should the closure (the blackbox) around the epistemic thing that makes it a technical object not retain its specific functional place in the ensemble of the experimental system"[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163] 

He describes how _unprecedented events_ are created -- or "registered" -- by experimental systems which are themselves "material systems of [[differential play]]":[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163]

>Being unprecedented, those events must be of a type that exceeds what is currently known; thus, they tend to first appear as disturbance, irritation, contamination, or noise--that is, as by-products of what knowledge can already cover. Out of those traces that mark unprecedented events, epistemic things emerge as initial, tentative supplements to what is seen as the cause of those events.[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163]

He seems to be saying that an epistemic thing is a "tentative supplement" to something that is viewed as the "cause" of an unprecedented event. What is a tentative supplement? And does he mean that it is an experimental system that is the "cause"? 


>So what about an epistemic thing’s temporal structure? To answer the question, it is important to remember that an epistemic thing is not a material object but an event emergent from the differential play of the experimental system and its resultant traces or graphemes, as Rheinberger prefers to call them. In effect, the event isn’t first of all an abrupt rupture in the fabric of knowledge, although it may be retrospectively narrated as such (Rheinberger 2013, 203). Rather, traces have to resonate (Rheinberger 1997, 65) and come together within the different spaces of representation employed in the system as well as in its temporal structure. The event has to be multiple, that is, recurrent, since this is how difference is registered in time. Still, without such a coming together, there is no event and no epistemic thing.

_thoughts & links:_

- concept of _epistemic potential_ (p.163) is intriguing for #finger-pointing-moon; as are technical objects. Perhaps I am looking at epistemic potential (and limits) of observation in experimental body-based practices (why experimental? -- more like AM is highly distilled -- a more closed 'system' with which to observe the complexity). 
- what might a technical object be in #practice-research? That is, am I wanting to build a technical object -- through the lexicon? or through a system of observation? 
- what might an _unprecedented event_ be in #finger-pointing-moon?
- #unfinished -- I ought to go to Rheinberger's original text for this note
