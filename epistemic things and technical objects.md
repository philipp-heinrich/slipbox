# epistemic things and technical objects

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experimental systems]]

---

Michael Schwab describes _epistemic things_ and _technical objects_ as follows:

>An epistemic thing appears as an as (yet) unknown material trace in an experimental system, which over time as it is increasingly understood is rendered into what Rheinberger calls a technical object, that is, a blackboxed, functional unit ready to be deployed either in future experimental systems or the marketplace.[@schwab_experimental_2019 pp.162-163]

Schwab discusses how Rheinberger considers that the epistemic potential of a _thing_ is reduced as that thing comes to be known or closer to being a technical object. It is also possible for a technical object to be re-rendered as an epistemic thing "should the closure (the blackbox) around the epistemic thing that makes it a technical object not retain its specific functional place in the ensemble of the experimental system"[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163] 

>Being unprecedented, those events must be of a type that exceeds what is currently known; thus, they tend to first appear as disturbance, irritation, contamination, or noise--that is, as by-products of what knowledge can already cover. Out of those traces that mark unprecedented events, epistemic things emerge as initial, tentative supplements to what is seen as the cause of those events.[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163]

He seems to be saying that an epistemic thing is a "tentative supplement" to something that is viewed as the "cause" of an unprecedented event. What is a tentative supplement? And does he mean that it is an experimental system that is the "cause"? He really is a convoluted writer -- so frustrating.

An epistemic thing is an event that is not "an abrupt rupture in the fabric of knowledge."[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.167] Schwab describes how this event must be multiple or "recurrent" as "this is how difference is registered in time."[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.167]

_thoughts & links:_

- concept of _epistemic potential_ (p.163) is intriguing for #finger-pointing-moon; as are technical objects. Perhaps I am looking at epistemic potential (and limits) of observation in experimental body-based practices (why experimental? -- more like AM is highly distilled -- a more closed 'system' with which to observe the complexity). 
- what might a technical object be in #practice-research? That is, am I wanting to build a technical object -- through the lexicon? or through a system of observation? 
- what might an _unprecedented event_ be in #finger-pointing-moon?
- [[differential play]] -- link to separate note from same paper. Not yet sure I understand differential play at all
