#Â direct experience through the senses

_previous note:_ [senses united by action](x-devonthink-item://5C883B83-F7A5-4EE4-8F58-C39CE81F6503)

In their book _Mindfulness_, Clinical Psychologist Mark Williams and meditation teacher Danny Penman describe the way the mind can not only think, but can also be aware that it is thinking. They write that we humans are also able to experience things directly through our senses without needing langauge "to stand as an intermediary between us and the world".[@williams_mindfulness_2012 Chapter 1]

_questions & thoughts:_

- my thought here is about a tentative link between direct exerience and intrinsic value. That direct experiences perhaps have a different relationship to value. It's tentative at best
- what is the role of thinking in somatic practices? See for instance [interrupting habits](x-devonthink-item://0BC8CD7F-FD77-4F48-811B-B6E5B00B2A35)
