# an interface is always an effect

_previous note:_ 

---

Alexander R. Galloway's book _The Interface Effect_ is about thresholds -- "those mysterious zones of interaction that mediate between different realities".[@galloway_interface_2012 p.vii] It is about computers, screens, peripherals and all the other things that seem to be part of our digital lives, and "none of these things in particular."[@galloway_interface_2012 p.vii]

>visual interfaces ignores other critical objects, such as “nonoptical interfaces (keyboard, mouse, controller, sensor); data in memory and data on disk; executable algorithms; networking technologies and protocols […].” (Galloway 2012). (Carol's PhD)

An interface, for Galloway, is “not a thing”; it is “always an effect” (p.33) — a technique of mediation or interaction (Galloway 2012 ref).
