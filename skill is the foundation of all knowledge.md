# skill is the foundation of all knowledge

>skill is the foundation of all knowledge[@ingold_transmission_2001 p.136]

describes difference between knowledge and information. information opens a path towards knowledge through the application of skill (which is gained through experience). example of cook-book

>Thus the information in the recipe book is not, in itself, knowledge. Rather, it opens up a path to knowledge, thanks to its location within a taskscape that is already partially familiar by virtue of previous experience. Only when placed in the context of skills gained through this prior experience does information specify a route that is comprehensible and that can practicably be followed, and only a route so specified can lead [p.138] to knowledge. It is in this sense that all knowledge is founded in skill. Just as my knowledge of the landscape is gained by walking through it, following various signposted routes, so my knowledge of the taskscape comes from following the several recipes in the book. This is not knowledge that has been communicated to me; it is knowledge I have built up for myself by following the same paths as my predecessors and under their direction. In short, the growth of knowledge in the life history of a person is a result not of information transmission but of guided rediscovery.[@ingold_transmission_2001 pp.137-138]
