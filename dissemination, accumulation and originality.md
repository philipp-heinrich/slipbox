# dissemination, accumulation and originality

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

---

In Biggs and Büchler's eight criteria for practice-research they adopt a single axiom in their approach: that research is cumulative. They suggest this _axiom_ is a "fundamental assumption that cannot be explained and for which our system cannot give any justification".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

>If research is cumulative, then what is done simply for the personal advancement of the individual is not research.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

Biggs and Büchler's criteria mean that in order for research to be part of a process of accumulation it must be disseminated. They suggest that when work is disseminated it "demonstrates, through the possibility of comparison, whether the work is original or not."[@biggs_eight_2008 p.16]

In my experience the role of dissemination in PaR has come to signify an end point; that, once shared, the work's role in the community of research grinds to a halt. But if research is cumulative -- and I agree strongly with Biggs and Büchler that it is -- then what is profoundly lacking in practice-research are the conversations that happen between different artistic-research projects after they are disseminated. These are conversations of comparison, of disagreement, of possibility ...
