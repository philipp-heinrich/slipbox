# dissemination, accumulation and originality

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

---

In Biggs and Büchler's eight criteria for practice-research they adopt a single axiom in their approach: that research is cumulative. They suggest this _axiom_ is a "fundamental assumption that cannot be explained and for which our system cannot give any justification".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

>If research is cumulative, then what is done simply for the personal advancement of the individual is not research.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.8]

Biggs and Büchler's criteria mean that in order for research to be part of a process of accumulation it must be disseminated. They suggest that when work is disseminated it "demonstrates, through the possibility of comparison, whether the work is original or not."[@biggs_eight_2008 p.16]

In my experience the role of dissemination in PaR has come to signify an end point; that, once shared, the work's role in the community of research grinds to a halt. But if research is cumulative -- and I agree strongly with Biggs and Büchler that it is -- then what is profoundly lacking in practice-research are the conversations that happen between different artistic-research projects after they are disseminated. These are conversations of comparison, of disagreement, of possibility ...

- [[early questions for practice-research]]
- [[two definitions of research in practice-research]]
- [[an exposition in practice-research]]
- [[conversation and understanding]]
- it seems though that Biggs and Buchler contradict themselves in [[biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions#^82f349]] -- or at least in how I want to pursue the value/importance of cumulative research. This is the nub really. I think though that art practices are cumulative, it's just that we don't own that cumulative effect transparently (as would be expected in research). It is I suspect complicated by what Biggs and Buchler describe as the focus of artists on producing experiences: [[biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions#^15277b]] but I don't imagine the desire to produce experiences implies one can't be clear about the accumulation of understanding. This directly goes back to Noe's idea about jokes and descriptions which I write in the note [[a case for writing in practice-research]] ^d0ec3a
- what is lost if artistic-research is not cumulative? Can it still be called research? I don't for a second think it can: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research).
