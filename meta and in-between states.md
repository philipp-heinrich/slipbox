# meta and in-between states 

_previous note:_ [[data, experience and thinking]]

---

This note follows on from my quoting of Galloway in relation to the nature of data. In the [blog post](http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/metadata-as-a-problem-for-thinking) Galloway describes the relationship between meta, matter and media, and how they, in various ways, refer to the middle:

>And the middle has long been a problem for philosophy. The middle is often the thing that philosophy can't think, or won't think. Indeed feminists have long made this very point, that "in between" states are perennially marginalized in philosophy. [...] If you wonder why philosophy has always had such a hard time with ambiguity, multiplicity, or superposition it's because the state of being-in-between has been excluded from the foundations of logic since the beginning, or at least since Aristotle. 



_questions & thoughts:_

- obvious thinking about being in the middle of something (centrist) versus on the periphery or in the margins. That the middle is maginalized

_consider:_

- [[future responsibility and stewardship]] -- the link here for me is about responsability in relation to these hard to describe experiences and phenomena, and in particular for the future (and our "promises" to the future)
- [[snowden on metadata]] -- reminded also of Snowden's thinking on metadata that I cite in Corporeal Epistemics
