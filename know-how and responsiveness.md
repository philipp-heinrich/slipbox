# know-how and responsiveness

_previous note:_ [[empirical research]]

---

This entry for _knowledge how_ in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is by Jeremy Fantl. He describes the Greek concepts of _epistêmê_ (knowledge) and _technê_ (craft or art). These terms, more or less, map onto the difference between knowledge-that and knowledge-how.

Fantl's overview of know-how is detailed. For the purposes of this note I'll mention one thing that caught my eye:

>For Ryle, then, to know how to do something is to be disposed to behave in certain ways, and it's going to be very hard to specify in advance what those ways are. It will depend on the situation and on what the goals of the knower are.[@fantl_knowledge_2012]


_questions & thoughts:_

- I'm drawn to the fluidity here of know-how which creates some tension for me in how I've described know-how as something we all share before research even happens. Perhaps though my point would be that the key thing would be to somehow _capture_ or communicate that responsiveness, that adaptation. This would be the key outcome: change in know-how.
