>It is striking that most discourses that seek to emphasise or even supply an epistemology [p.162] for contemporary art are more likely to approach it from an idealist rather than empiricist perspective, for which in particular the experimental sciences may stand.[@schwab_experimental_2019 pp.161-162]

>I am testing how a structure concep- tualised in the history of science to describe temporal phenomena in early-twentieth-century laboratories may help shed light on something in art that is seemingly unrelated.(p.162)

>When engaging with Rheinberger’s philosophy, the concept of epistemic things seems arguably to be the most productive to artistic researchers (Borgdorff 2012; Schwab 2013, 2014a). An epistemic thing appears as an as (yet) unknown [p.163] material trace in an experimental system, which over time as it is increasingly understood is rendered into what Rheinberger calls a technical object, that is, a blackboxed, functional unit ready to be deployed either in future experimental systems or the marketplace.

p.163: epistemic potential -- very very useful #finger-pointing-moon 
as are technical objects ... looking at epistemic potential (and limits) of observation in experimental body-based practices (why experimental?) more like AM is highly distilled -- a more closed 'system' with which to observe the complexity. 
what might a technical object be in PaR?
that is, I'm wanting to build a technical object? through the lexicon? or through a system of observation? 

>Experimental systems are material systems of differential play designed to register _unprecedented events_. Being unprecedented, those events must be of a type that exceeds what is currently known; thus, they tend to first appear as disturbance, irritation, contamination, or noise—that is, as by-products of what knowledge can already cover. Out of those traces that mark unprecedented events, epistemic things emerge as initial, tentative supplements to what is seen as the cause of those events.[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163]

what might an unprecedented event be in _Finger Pointing Moon_?

>The journey from trace (comparatively unknown) to technical object (com- paratively known) is described by Rheinberger (1994) as historial, that is, his- tory-making rather than historical, that is, made-in-history. The notion of historial here is also loaned from Derrida in order to express two different, simultaneous currents of history. The first looks forward into a future, open horizon built on past facts and secured by the chronological passing of time. The second looks backward into a rich bed of possible origins that need to be actualised should the future be possible. A historical perspective values only the first current, where events happen in history and affect only the future; a historial perspective, in contrast, accounts for both currents. An event looked at historially may be seen like a temporal mirror with time running both for- ward to a future and backward to its past.163

>In the context of the argument about artistic research that I am attempt- ing here, at least two aspects deserve attention. First, with regard to research, failures to engage with deeper, historial notions of history risk impoverishing the research to a degree at which it becomes impossible. Hence, Rheinberger (2016) argues for necessary encounters between the sciences and humanities to find an approach to knowledge objects mindful of their own inherent dyna- mism that neither an empiricist nor rationalist image of research can touch.p.165

>As suggested by the above critique of a modernist approach, emphasis has to be moved from objects with a more or less stable historical identity—like “masterworks” that represent the achievements of the research—to more pre- carious, ambivalent, or provisional things. In line with this thinking, Borgdorff understands artworks as epistemic things rather than technical objects, as could also have been claimed. As Borgdorff (2012, 193) says, “within artistic practices, artworks are the hybrid objects, situations, or events—the epistemic things—that constitute the driving force in artistic research.” He attests a lack of completeness that indicates (via Adorno) both their status as art and their potential to continue to unfold into knowledge. p.166

-- i like the idea of provisional things 

>Regardless of how one may finally decide on the ontology of contemporary works of art, when linking it to Rheinberger’s philosophy, these diverse positions agree in one point: value lies with what is unknown, underdetermined, and open, as associated with epistemic things, and not with what is known, identified, and closed, which is the functional position of technical objects.p.167

- this is what I'm proposing ... to know and to identify. to devalue something? 
- not sure about this though. Because Schwab's use of epistemic thing just indicates to me that we end up (like in JAR) with proliferation of (useless) epistemic things. It's the next step -- the in dialogue that is the thing that is impoverished??? 

>So what about an epistemic thing’s temporal structure? To answer the ques- tion, it is important to remember that an epistemic thing is not a material object but an event emergent from the differential play of the experimental system and its resultant traces or graphemes, as Rheinberger prefers to call them. In effect, the event isn’t first of all an abrupt rupture in the fabric of knowledge, although it may be retrospectively narrated as such (Rheinberger 2013, 203). Rather, traces have to resonate (Rheinberger 1997, 65) and come together within the different spaces of representation employed in the system as well as in its temporal struc- ture. The event has to be multiple, that is, recurrent, since this is how difference is registered in time. Still, without such a coming together, there is no event and no epistemic thing. p.167
