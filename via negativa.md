# via negativa

_previous note:_ [[contemplation beyond rationalization]]

---

This concept is mentioned in a footnote to Kerr's analysis of Borgmann and Merton's thinking about contemplation and technology. Kerr writes that in _New Seeds of Contemplation_ Merton uses a "philosophical method ancient and medieval called the via negativa":[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.77]

>coming to define something by delineating what a thing is not.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.77]

It has close links with [apophatic theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology), and the sense of approaching that which cannot be known.

- curious connection with some of my previous thinking about documentation. See [20190121 - documentation and the cloud of unknowing.md](hook://file/odgmCdflF?p=YXJjaGl2ZWRfcHJvamVjdHMvMjAxOTAxMjMgLSBkb2N1bWVudGF0aW9uIGFuZCB0aGUgY2xvdWQgb2YgdW5rbm93aW5n&n=20190121%20-%20documentation%20and%20the%20cloud%20of%20unknowing.md) and also [HandsThatDontWantAnything.pdf](hook://file/odgwbYZO0?p=MjAwOTA5MDEgLSBUYVBSQTIwMDkgLSBpbXByb3Zpc2F0aW9uL1ByZXNlbnRhdGlvbg==&n=HandsThatDontWantAnything.pdf). But also very strong connection with #finger-pointing-moon
