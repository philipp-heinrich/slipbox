# truth and beliefs

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

---

AI research Eliezer Yudkowsky has a blog post called _The Useful Idea of Truth_. It's part of a longer collection of posts [Highly Advanced Epistemology 101 for Beginners](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs).

>So is all this talk of truth just comparing other people's beliefs to our own beliefs, and trying to assert privilege? Is the word 'truth' just a weapon in a power struggle?

>If the above is true, aren't the postmodernists right? Isn't all this talk of 'truth' just an attempt to assert the privilege of your own beliefs over others, when there's nothing that can actually compare a belief to reality itself, outside of anyone's head?

>my beliefs determine my experimental predictions, but only reality gets to determine my experimental results.

>The abstract concept of 'truth' - the general idea of a map-territory correspondence - is required to express ideas such as:

>This is the main benefit of talking and thinking about 'truth' - that we can generalize rules about how to make maps match territories in general; we can learn lessons that transfer beyond particular skies being blue.

>They're floating beliefs not connected with the rest of the model.

-- this is like practice-research: floating beliefs (super useful)

>One classic response to this problem was verificationism, which held that the sentence "Elaine is a post-utopian" is meaningless if it doesn't tell us which sensory experiences we should expect to see if the sentence is true, and how those experiences differ from the case if the sentence is false.

- this is precisely what I'm proposing in #finger-pointing-moon !




#unfinished (am up to here going through the article: You might next try the answer that for a statement to be meaningful, there must be some way reality can be which makes the statement true or false)

_questions & thoughts:_

- love his use of _meditation_ as a kind of directive in the middle of the text: 

>A 'meditation' is a puzzle that the reader is meant to attempt to solve before continuing. It's my somewhat awkward attempt to reflect the research which shows that you're much more likely to remember a fact or solution if you try to solve the problem yourself before reading the solution; succeed or fail, the important thing is to have tried first .[@yudkowsky_useful_2012 n.p.]

_consider:_

- practice-research as simply a set of beliefs
