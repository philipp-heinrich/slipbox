# truth and beliefs

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

---

AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky has a blog post called _The Useful Idea of Truth_. It's part of a longer collection of posts [Highly Advanced Epistemology 101 for Beginners](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs). This particular post is a collection of thoughts on the relationship between beliefs and truth, and can be summarised by this statement:

>my beliefs determine my experimental predictions, but only reality gets to determine my experimental results.

Yudkowsky describes truth as "the general idea of a map-territory correspondence", and such correspondence means that we can "learn lessons that transfer beyond particular" schemes or situations (generalisability). He gives a detailed example based on the made-up idea of _post-utopianism_. In the example Yudowsky describes a situation in which two connected phrases remain unconnected to anything else; they are "floating beliefs not connected with the rest of the model."

>One classic response to this problem [of floating beliefs] was _verificationism_, which held that the sentence "Elaine is a post-utopian" is meaningless if it doesn't tell us which sensory experiences we should expect to see if the sentence is true, and how those experiences differ from the case if the sentence is false.



_questions & thoughts:_

- love his use of _meditation_ as a kind of directive in the middle of the text: 

>A 'meditation' is a puzzle that the reader is meant to attempt to solve before continuing. It's my somewhat awkward attempt to reflect the research which shows that you're much more likely to remember a fact or solution if you try to solve the problem yourself before reading the solution; succeed or fail, the important thing is to have tried first .[@yudkowsky_useful_2012 n.p.]

- I found the examples hard to decipher (that kind of logic of thinking doesn't come so easy to me)

_consider:_

- [[terministic screens]] - the ways in which words/terms (like in the example of post-utopianism) become disconnected from a model
- #practice-research as simply a set of beliefs
- floating beliefs are like in practice-research
- verificationism is akin to what I'm proposing in #finger-pointing-moon; and the (sensory) claims we can (or can't make), and how they might be falsified or verified
- [[conversation and understanding]] - NoÃ«'s thinking that what art produces is more like a score (as opposed to truth). That we are changed by art (but how might we recognise that change?)
- [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]
- [[epistemic rationality]]
- [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]]
- [[descriptions and sense data]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[the map is not the territory]]
- [[map and territory]]
