# practice-research names

_previous note:_ 

---

I'm not overly tempted by the thought of doing a literature search regarding nomenclature in practice-research. My guess is that such a search would reveal just how big a mess we have made of what to call this kind of research. 

list them here ...

>There are different names for this kind of research, and some communities are very sensitive about the different nuances that these names connote. Finding a good name to describe the field has proven to be difficult, and the list of names used by others is very long. For example, terms like ‘artistic research’ are rejected by the design community; ‘creative research’ suggests that other research is not creative; ‘practice-based’ does not clarify what kind of practice, e.g. arts, education, healthcare, nor does the term clarify how practices leading to research outcomes differ from practices leading to professional outcomes.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.82]

>Broadly speaking they all present the same problem and that is: what it is to undertake research in a practice-based area. In particular, there is an interest in research that is not historically led or to do with technology, but instead is to do with the actual production of the stuff itself. We think that the problem arises when these professional activities are pushed into the academic context.[p.82]

what kinds of practices? 
[[research on, for and in the arts]] - useful (but need to make sure I've got it right)
