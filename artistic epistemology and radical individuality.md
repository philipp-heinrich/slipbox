# artistic epistemology and radical individuality

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experiment]]

---

>it is less helpful to decide whether any concrete epistemic thing is fact or fiction; rather, an artistic epistemology is suggested that focuses on the radical individuality of such a thing and the way in which artistic research practice may need to protect its individuality as a site for particular knowledges.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.120]

>Thus, an artistic epistemology needs to reject notions of ‘truth’ to which artistic practice is subservient. At the same time, it needs to support artistic modes of identifying certain unique, material things as true, in the sense that they can be witnessed as epistemically relevant despite their unknown status, in other words, as a matter of fact. This can only happen on a case-by-case basis where the experimental system both produces and protects its epistemic thing as a unique being. However, given the rejection of ‘truth’, such protection cannot displace the epistemic thing into either negativity or concealment; rather, meaning needs to remain materially accessible.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.129] 

- individuality from what? or compared with what?

_thoughts & links:_

- Schwab's thought re 'unknown status' reminded me of fuzzy concepts in  [[concept as method#^1a3c82]]
- I think I need to understand the concept of an epistemic thing more clearly, and perhaps even in relation to [[modes of thought and practices enabled by modes of thought]] -- epistemology and ontology
