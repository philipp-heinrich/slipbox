# somatic feedback interrupts habits

_previous note:_  [[somatic processes]]

---

Loke and Schiphorst emphasise the role of learning by doing in somatic work, and that observing one's self and observing others while being guided is a critical part of the process. In learning somatic processes, they describe a "continual checking-in, cross-referencing, and calibration process"[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] between the deliberate actions completed with internal awareness by the learner, and information or guidance from a teacher or guide. Such _cross-referencing_ is a feedback loop between sensation, attention, personal reflection, and the support of another person. This feedback work is designed -- at least in part -- to interrupt "habitual ways of moving, sensing, and feeling ... to revitalize perception, or make new connections in reorganizing our sensory-motor neural pathways."[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] 

Later, they describe how this mode of somatic attention can be entered into by choice through a "process of attunement",[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] but that this kind of attention cannot be sustained.

_thoughts and links:_

- thinking here about Heidegger's [[gestell and enframing]], and Borgmann's [[device paradigm and focal things]] and imagining somatics as a method to re-enframe, to re-orient our relationship to one's own body; as if one's body is the 'technological thing' that is enframed. 
- also linking to the [[body of the film]] and the idea that we only see the "perception and expression that it makes possible, but not the body itself".[@barker_tactile_2009 p.10]. That in many respects somatics is a way of making the mechanisms, patterns and habits of the body transparent. Talk about news flash. And yet it gets much messier when integrating Ginot's ideas regarding prostheses, instruments and the fact that [[there is no natural soma]].

- [[somatic processes]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
