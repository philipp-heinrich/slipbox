# viola - time and process

_previous note:_ 

---

>It is not the monitor, or the camera, or the tape, that is the basic material of video, but time itself. Once you begin to work with time as an elemental material, you have entered the domain of conceptual space. A thought is a function of time, not a discrete object. It is a process of unfoldment, an evolving thread of the living moment. Awareness of time brings you into a world of process, into moving images that embody the movement of human consciousness itself. Duration is to consciousness as light is to the eye.

-- Bill Viola, 1989
