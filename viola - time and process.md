# viola - time and process

_previous note:_ [[words, promises and time]]

---

>It is not the monitor, or the camera, or the tape, that is the basic material of video, but time itself. Once you begin to work with time as an elemental material, you have entered the domain of conceptual space. A thought is a function of time, not a discrete object. It is a process of unfoldment, an evolving thread of the living moment. Awareness of time brings you into a world of process, into moving images that embody the movement of human consciousness itself. Duration is to consciousness as light is to the eye.

-- Bill Viola, 1989 in [@viola_reasons_1995]

_thoughts & links:

- it's not clear to me what BV means by "conceptual space"
- beautiful sense of movement in his description of a thought. As if a thought is never really a singular thing, or it is _only_ a singular thing that we cut up into discrete objects to help try and make sense of it/them. 
- the last statement -- "Duration is to consciousness (etc)" -- is a little confusing. If light makes vision possible, then Viola is suggesting that duration makes consciousness possible. Is this what he means? 
- [[descriptions and sense data]] -- see this also in relation to [[viola - image of the inner state]]
- very tenuous link to [[apophatic theology]] -- that we are only ever approaching something: representations or words of what something is not
- [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]] -- that being through time is an act of re-membering
- see Hume quote in [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[contemplation beyond rationalization]]
- [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]]
- [[internal and external attention]]
