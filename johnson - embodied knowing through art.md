# johnson - embodied knowing through art

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

Mark Johnson's Chapter in The Routledge Companion to the Arts[@biggs_routledge_2011] is called _Embodied Knowing Through Art_. His proposition is that the arts already possess strong claims to "deep understanding"[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.142] but what is required is that we change a "very deeply rooted traditional conception of knowledge as a body of true propositions that capture the nature of some particular aspect of our world."[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.142] In its place Johnson calls on Dewey and suggests that "knowledge should be a term of praise for success in a process for intelligently transforming experience."[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.142]

>Aristotle recognized a more positive role for artistic imitations, claiming that poetry can ‘present the kind of thing that might be’, thereby suggesting that the arts can reveal the possibilities of experience. however, Aristotle thought that the arts show what is possible via _mimesis_ of human actions, whereas the sciences give causal accounts of how things come to be as they are and why they behave as they do.[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.143] -- see [[research, anticipation and the future]]

>Research for art ‘claims material interventions that transform what is apprehended as art, together with a claim to knowledge of the manner in which art has thereby been transformed’ (Scrivener 2009b). By these criteria, a painting that gives us new knowledge of some aspect of our world might also be innovative enough to shape our very understanding of art and open up novel possibilities for future art.[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.145]

He focuses on Dewey and change -- and changes brought about by embodied cognition. It's super useful. But, it also fails to deal with hyper-specificity problem in #finger-pointing-moon 

>Thus Dewey proposes knowing as an activity of thought in the service of constructive change in the quality and character of our experience ...[p.146]

>The locus of knowledge, according to Dewey, is experience, interpreted in the broadest sense to include both physical objects and states of affairs, but also everything that is thought, felt, hoped for, willed, desired, encountered, and done.[p.146]

>for Dewey knowing is a matter of cultivating appropriate habits of intelligent inquiry that allow us to more or less satisfactorily reconfigure our experience in the face of problematic situations. The goal is not some illusory fixed and eternal knowledge. Instead, to call something ‘knowledge’ is simply a way to valorize certain ways of knowing – ways of transforming experience – that tend to actually enrich our sense of the possibilities for action, that deepen and broaden our grasp of the meaning of a situation, and that help us lead more humane, constructive, and creative lives. So Dewey urges us to turn our focus away from the substantive term knowledge (as a noun) and to focus, instead, on knowing (as a verb). In this way we emphasize the character of the process of inquiry instead of some final product construed as a body of knowledge.[p.147]

>Artistic inquiry is less abstractive and generalizing than science, focusing more on grasping the qualitative unity of a situation. Art, in Dewey’s view, does not so much describe or explain; rather, it presents or enacts the qualities, meanings, and values of a situation.[p.147]

>Dewey saw that his account of inquiry and knowing reveals a deep parallel between acts of knowing and the processes of experiencing, making, and judging art. [p.147]

>Our thinking is visceral and incarnate, whether that thinking is primarily artistic or primarily linguistic.[p.149]

>The making of artworks is thus an ongoing exercise – an apprenticeship – in how to remake experience to enhance meaning. it shows us how things might be developed in the service of consummatory experience, more than it gives us a particular body of knowledge.[p.150]

>Both art and science are about the transformation of experience to enrich meaning, open up new connections, and help us harmonize our experiences. art may focus more intently on the qualitative unity of the experience (the work), while science focuses more on causal relations and connections, but both of them are transformative modes of inquiry.[p.150]

_thoughts & links:_

- contrast Johnson's position in relation to changing our conception of knowledge to 'fit' arts research with Situated Position of Biggs and Buchler: [[connection between question, answer and method]]
- Johnson's description of Kant's influence on aesthetics and knowledge is pretty useful. Makes me think that there are two epistemic branches to PaR: the more common which is to re-configure what knowledge is; the less common is the Situated Position of Biggs and Buchler. Also possible here to tie in with Friedman's position (via personal communication) on how little art practice is actually research? #finger-pointing-moon 
- falls into trap of the way art functions for audiences? (or, at least, shifts between two distinct perspectives: makers and audiences). But am I assuming they are distinct perspectives? He seems to focus on process of art but for transformation of audience. It's so odd not to be clear about this.
- strong connections (generally) with Noé's thinking on the value, role and function of art, e.g. [[art as source of knowledge]]
- this article is really a case for art as a way of knowing. But, I don't think it cuts to the chase at all about art as a form of research. (except indirectly -- the implication being if something is 'dealing with knowing' then it is a form of research. But I don't buy that at all)
- he seems to reside in the 'all art is research' camp
- p.151: making a case for how art and science research ought to be thought of as being the same: "ongoing inquiry aiming at the transformation of a problematic situation into one that is more harmonious, fluid, expansive, and rich in meaning" -- really? This language is so odd. This is bizarre. Compare with Biggs and Buchler's situated position. 
- then makes case for relying on experts to decide (similar to the way that JaR seems to suggest: [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]] and [[an exposition in practice-research]])
