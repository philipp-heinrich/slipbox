# johnson - embodied knowing through art

_previous note:_ 

---

>Just as with the arts, the whole question of method can seem a little bit out of place, and without methods of inquiry, what sense can you make of knowledge and research?[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.142]

>I want to suggest that, in spite of these obstacles to the acknowledgment of a significant role for art in the evocation of deep understanding, there are, nevertheless, perfectly good notions of arts research and quite reasonable notions of inquiry in art. however, to articulate these notions, we have to overcome a very deeply rooted traditional conception of knowledge as a body of true propositions that capture the nature of some particular aspect of our world. The key is to stop thinking of knowledge as an abstract quasi-entity or a fixed body of propositional claims. instead, knowledge should be a term of praise for success in a process for intelligently transforming experience, just as the american philosopher John dewey argued some eighty years ago.[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.142]

- contrast this with Situated Position of Biggs and Buchler

#toread Dewey and transforming experience

>Aristotle recognized a more positive role for artistic imitations, claiming that poetry can ‘present the kind of thing that might be’, thereby suggesting that the arts can reveal the possibilities of experience. however, Aristotle thought that the arts show what is possible via _mimesis_ of human actions, whereas the sciences give causal accounts of how things come to be as they are and why they behave as they do.[@johnson_embodied_2011 p.143] -- see [[research, anticipation and the future]]

His description of Kant's influence on aesthetics and knowledge is pretty useful. Makes me think that there are two branches to PaR: the more common which is to re-configure what knowledge is; the less common is the Situated Position of Biggs and Buchler. Also possible here to tie in with Friedman's position on how little art practice is actually research?
