# search for truth 

_previous note:_  

---

In this presentation about the nature of research in art, anthropologist Tim Ingold discusses the value of seeking truth. He describes research as being "aspirational" in its pursuit of truth, and that truth in itself is "absolutely not objective fact".[@ingold_search_2018 np] He says:

>Truth is the unison of imagination and experience  [...] Truth requires that we take ourselves into the world. We canâ€™t remain outside of it.

>There is danger in conflating truth and objectivity. It is the search for truth that underpins research. Search and search again. Research is continually conducted in the dark.

I'm drawn to this idea of how he values the search, and how integrity -- or perhaps rigor -- in research comes from grappling with the materials and their possibilities, not from finding _a truth_.
 
I wonder though what other kinds of truths exist. [noting a thought on 21/1/21 given that this note was created on 22/7/20: I don't know how I feel about this now. I suspect that the University (and in particular post-modernism) has for too long been complicit in damaging ideas about _truths_ and constructing the building blocks for a 'post-truth' world. That there is, in effect, blood on our hands. See for instance Cynical Theories by Pluckrose and Lindsay.]

_thoughts & links:_

- how does Ingold's conception of truth sit with the distinction between the [[map and territory]]?
- or even just the idea of 'reality'?
