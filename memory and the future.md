>Memory, they found, serves many functions – and one of them is to allow us to simulate the future. The idea that without a sense of past we can’t have a sense of the future isn’t metaphorical. It is the physical reality of how our brains operate. We draw from the past in order to imagine what lies ahead.2 ‘The whole point of the brain’, Maguire told me, ‘is future planning. You need to survive and think about what happened when I was last here – is there a scary monster that will come out and eat me? We create models of the future by recruiting our memories of the past.’
