# habitual ways of seeing

_previous note:_ [[art as source of knowledge]]

---

In _How to Do Nothing_, the American artist Jenny Odell states that, "the only habit worth 'designing for' is the habit of questioning oneâ€™s habitual ways of seeing, and that is what artists, writers, and musicians help us to do."[@odell_how_2019 Chapter 4, n.p.]

_questions & thoughts:_

- how do these arts help us to do this questioning? 
- what are the lines between the arts _working_ and _not working_ in relation to our ways of seeing?

_consider:_

- [[interrupting habits]]
- [[gestell and enframing]]

- John Berger's _Ways of Seeing_
