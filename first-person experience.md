# first-person experience

_previous note:_  [[the field of somatics]]

---

The biologist, mathematician, cognitive scientist and philosopher Francisco Varela described "first-person events" as being the "_lived_ experience associated with cognitive and mental events." [@varela_first-person_1999 p.1] He compares them with third-person descriptions of natural phenomena, but reminds us that the subjective is always already implicit in the objective. Moreover, he describes first-person descriptions presented in isolation as "futile"[p.2] and that they ought to be harmonized and constrained by "building the appropriate _links_ with third-person studies"[p.2]

>In brief our stance in regards to first-person methodologies is this: don’t leave home without it, but do not forget to bring along third-person accounts as well.[p.2]

Towards the end of the article (which is an introduction to an entire volume on first-person methods), Varela suggests that what is required is a second-person intermediary.

>From a second-person position, what appeared merely as overt external behaviour is now taken explicitly as traces or manifestation of mental life, and furthermore as the only lead into what such mental life is.[@varela_first-person_1999 p.10]

This second-person mediator must be deeply experienced in the method/practice being observed; her work is "grounded on a sensitivity to the subtle indices of his interlocutor’s phrasing, bodily language and expressive- ness, seeking for indices (more or less explicit) which are inroads into the common experiential ground."[@varela_first-person_1999 p.10]

Varela also warns that, just because each of us is apparently familiar with our subjective lives, we must clearly examine which parts we can and cannot have access to. Furtherstill, the differences in access are fluid and liable to change:

>It is here that methodology appears as crucial: without a sustained examination we actually do not produce phenomenal descriptions that are rich and subtly interconnected enough in comparison to third-person accounts.[p.2]

The somatics expert Glenna Batson writes of Varela's work that he thought "first-person experience should be the starting point for understanding cognition,"[@batson_body_2014 p.77] and that his views were -- and are -- important to somatics practitioners and scholars.

_thoughts & links:_

- where Batson writes of his importance to somatics, I read his scepticism towards first-person experiences as a methodology
- this article is a fantastic overview of the problem of examining experience
- possible to incorporate second and/or third-person in #finger-pointing-moon ?
- also re #finger-pointing-moon is Varela's thinking about what we can and cannot access and the 'sustained examination'
- compare with Hanna's account that the body as perceived from the inside is the study of the soma. Distinction between soma and body is intriguing. Hanna also makes distinction between _perspective_ and _perception_. Smart dude.
