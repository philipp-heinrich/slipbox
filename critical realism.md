# critical realism

_previous note:_ [[descriptions and sense data]]

Critical realism was developed by Roy Bhasker and it makes a distinction between what is real and what is observable. This is also a distinction between ontology and epistemology where ontological statements are about what is real, and epistemology statements and what we understand or know about the real.

The principle concern of critical realism is to understand the underlying (and unobservable) mechanisms which cause (observable) events.

Critical realism has grown to be an opponent of different forms of postmodernism.

>Since Bhaskar made the first big steps in popularising the theory of critical realism in the 1970s, it has become one of the major strands of social scientific method, rivalling positivism/empiricism, and post-structuralism/relativism/interpretivism.[@noauthor_critical_2020 n.p.]

Note idea of transitive vs intransitive bodies of knowledge -- _transitive_ referring to our experiential (and changeable) understanding of the real, and _intransitive_ reality which exists independently of our knowledge of it (and is unchanging).

Here's a quote from the Wiki page that notes the overlap with Marxist perspective:

>This dualist logic is clearly present in the Marxian theory of ideology, according to which social reality may be very different from its empirically observable surface appearance.

_consider:_

- [[the observer is the observed]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[empirical research]]
- hard to be sure how deep to go into this particular rabbit hole. Perhaps to understand how it might help the _authentic movement situation_ would be useful. That is, what might these unobservable mechanisms be in AM? But my guess is that it's difficult enough to be dealing with the observable ...
