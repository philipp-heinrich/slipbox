Just-noticeable is a term related to sense, sensation and perception in the field of experimental psychology. It refers to the smallest change in a phenomena that is able to be noticed. It is also called _difference limen_, _difference threshold_ and _least noticeable difference_.

_questions & thoughts:_

- related here to [[weber-fechner law]] and somatic practices
- what is that difference and how do we notice it? 
- what are the mechanisms for noticing change in somatic practice? and what skills or capacities are being developed? (e.g proprioception, interoception (as mentioned in [[practice of somatic movement education and therapy]]))
