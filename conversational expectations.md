# conversational expectations

_previous note:_ [[heterotopic discourse and the truth]]

---

The British language philosopher and theorist Paul Grice describes our conversational expectations via four maxims:

>Maxim of Quality—we expect the truth.

>Maxim of Quantity—we expect to get information we don’t already know and not so much that we feel overwhelmed.

>Maxim of Relation—we expect relevance and logical flow.

>Maxim of Manner—we expect the speaker to be reasonably brief, orderly, and unambiguous.[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 17, n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- Murphy writes that other scholars want to include "politeness and fairness in turn taking". This is strongly connected to the heterotopic form of discourse (and its other)
- I really like the plainness and simplicity of this list. It's kind of blunt

- [[Levinas and the ethics of listening]]
- [[feelings in conversations]]
