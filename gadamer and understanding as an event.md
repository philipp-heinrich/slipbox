# gadamer and understanding as an event

_previous note:_ [[epignosis and participating in knowing]]

---

In this book chapter Auslander revisits his previous work on mediatization and audiences. His priority is to describe the phenomenological experience of audiences watching mediatized events, while also understanding the ontology of these performances in relation to an event that occurred in another time and in another place. But my interest here is in Auslander's use of Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics to understand historicity and the past, and particularly its potential utility for practice-research epistemicszettelkasten. 

>Gadamer conceives our interaction with historical texts as dialogic, on the model of conversation. Understanding the performance means neither discovering its original meanings, seeing and hearing it as it was originally seen and heard, nor imposing our own meanings on it. ‘Understanding proves to be an event’, the emergent result of the conversation between ourselves and the performance, a conversation to which both sides are understood to contribute. ‘In this the interpreter’s own horizon is decisive’, writes Gadamer, and this is necessarily true, as the conversational event takes place in the present, against this horizon.[@auslander_reactivation_2009 p.87]

For Auslander, our experience of something now as opposed to _when_ it was produced is "co-determined" in "relation to our own horizon".[@auslander_reactivation_2009 p.87]

_questions & thoughts:_

- my _real_ interest here is in Gadamer's thinking about understanding as an event. It chimes strongly with the production of knowledge (ie understanding) in practice-research
- which begs the question, what is the difference between knowledge and understanding? Philsophically? Ethically?
