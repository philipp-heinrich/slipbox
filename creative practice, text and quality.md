# creative practice, text and quality 

>Some maintain that certain forms of creative practice can only become research when accompanied by writing (see, for example, Nelson 2013, 71–73; Vaes 2015); others believe that that the research can be embodied within the creative practice itself, a key issue in the debates following from John Croft’s article (2015a), responses by Ian Pace (2015a) and Camden Reeves (2015), and a further contribution from Croft (2015b), in the journal Tempo, on music composition and performance. Others have grappled with the meaning of quality in such outputs (for example, Schippers 2007; Biggs and Karlsson 2011). (p.6)
