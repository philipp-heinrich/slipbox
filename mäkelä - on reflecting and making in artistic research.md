# mäkelä - on reflecting and making in artistic research 

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

This writing is the editorial to an issue of Journal of Research Practice (which is no longer published) focused on artists working through practice in the academy.

The authors give a brief and useful overview of the history of #practice-research in art and design. They cover the naming conventions and problems, and identify three trends:

1. That artistic research can stand on its own in the academy (or alongside science research) That its epistemological basis lies in how artworks are experienced.
2. That an accompanying text or exegesis is required -- they imply (but don't state) if this is for all artistic research or solely for PhD-level work.
3. Growing desire to change the "understanding of research"[@makela_editorial_2011 n.p.] and to recognise the specific kinds of outcomes emerging from practice-research. Alongside this third trend is increasing focus on experimental modes of writing.

_thoughts & links:_

- useful for series of references covering these topics
- the writing is rather ambiguous and fails to deal critically with incongruent aspects of current thinking in practice-research
- [[artefacts and writing in practice-research]]
- I didn't look so closely but they also seem to get things wrong. For example, their description of Frayling's _research into, through and for_ contradicts Borgdorff's [[research on, for and in the arts]] (specifically the _for_ category)
