# belongingness hypothesis

## 6. SYNCHING FAST AND SLOW

>In 1995, two social psychologists, Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary, put forth what they called “the belongingness hypothesis.” They proposed that “a need to belong is a fundamental human motivation . . . and that much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness.” Other thinkers, including Sigmund Freud and Abraham Maslow, had made similar claims, but Baumeister and Leary set about finding empirical proof. The evidence they assembled was overwhelming (their twenty-six-page paper cites more than three hundred sources). Belongingness, they found, profoundly shapes our thoughts and emotions. Its absence leads to ill effects, its presence to health and satisfaction.
