# etymology of technology 

The distance between common use of the word _technology_ (more or less "digital technology"), the definition and the etymology is striking. It derives directly from "to weave" or "to fabricate".

_thoughts & links:_

- Jacobs draws on this distinction in his thinking on the [[mythical vs technological core of culture]] in which the mythical core is not subject to manipulation. Note that word manipulation and its relationship to hands ([etymology is from 'handful'](https://www.etymonline.com/word/manipulation#etymonline_v_6809))
- in [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]] he seems to use the word technology in relation to contemporary digital technologies. Nevertheless, his thinking regarding the cloister -- or spaces which are free from distraction of contemporary technology -- is fascinating.
