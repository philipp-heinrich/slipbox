# biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions

_previous note:_ 

---

>There are different names for this kind of research, and some communities are very sensitive about the different nuances that these names connote. Finding a good name to describe the field has proven to be difficult, and the list of names used by others is very long. For example, terms like ‘artistic research’ are rejected by the design community; ‘creative research’ suggests that other research is not creative; ‘practice-based’ does not clarify what kind of practice, e.g. arts, education, healthcare, nor does the term clarify how practices leading to research outcomes differ from practices leading to professional outcomes.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.82]

>In particular, there is an interest in research that is not historically led or to do with technology, but instead is to do with the actual production of the stuff itself. We think that the problem arises when these professional activities are pushed into the academic context.[p.82]

>We observe two different communities presenting conflicting claims: the community of academic researchers working in contexts such as university departments, and the community of professional practitioners working in contexts such as the concert hall or the art gallery. We also observe these communities being thrown together by external forces, and a new community of so-called practitioner-researchers becoming visible (Chapter 1). In a nutshell, the practitioner-researcher archetype refers to individuals who hold practitioner values but produce research in an academic context.
>In the parent communities, we see dissatisfaction. on the one hand, we hear the academic community at large – understood as academic researchers in any academic area and discipline – express the dissatisfaction that what creative practitioners produce is not academic research. On the other hand, we hear the dissatisfaction of the creative practitioner community that their values are not reflected in traditional academic research models and, as a result, when they use these models the outcomes are not relevant to them. Hence, there is dissatisfaction in both camps. In this chapter we identify the source and diagnose the nature of dissatisfaction that we observe in both the academic and creative practice communities, and discuss some of the actions that are employed in response to the problem.[p.83]

>However, it is not the actions that characterize a community because actions on their own do not have meaning. It is only through their inter-connectedness to other meaningful actions that they become significant. Writing a report or making a painting is not significant per se but only as part of a network of other valued actions (Hirsch 1984).[pp.84-85]

>Our definition of academic conventions is that they are a cipher for the network of actions that constitute meaningful research, and establish membership of the community by determining its professional codes and standards. In the same way, the world of professional creative practice has its codes which determine success and by which membership can be judged. We claim this even for contemporary creative practice, which appears to thrive on breaking rules and changing standards. However, in our view the professional practice of any activity is never a case of ‘anything goes’, despite occasional appearances to the contrary.[p.85]

>We believe that academic conventions provide a kind of shorthand for what activities the academic community needs and wants. If these academic conventions are unpacked, it will be possible to identify what are the specific requirements of each academic community. If these conventions are considered as a meta-level system, it will be possible to identify the actions that constitute research activity that is significant to the academic community in general, and that thus reflect the values of the academy. These values include elements such as rationalism – meaning the ability to explain the logical connection between one concept and another; and communication – meaning that ideas are shared and the academic community grows in its knowledge by this process (searle 1993). The aspect that we focused on was not whether this element or that element was important, but the observation that these elements described actions: the action of rationally connecting ideas, the action of disseminating outcomes, etc. These actions were undertaken because they reflected what the academic community valued, in this case for example, the values of connecting, building and sharing.[p.85]

>Connection through argumentation refers to a structure that produces an argument rather than any one particular argument – meaning that it refers to the rational connection of ideas rather than the advocacy of a particular position.[p.86]
- this is so distinct from [[standpoint epistemology]]and [[mesearch]]. 

>If research is defined as being cumulative then it is clear that one is concerned with academic research. Therefore the methods need to include inquiry into what has been done already, and making the outcomes public so that other researchers do not duplicate the work. It also clarifies that research is something done by communities resulting in collective benefit rather than by the isolated genius who does not share their work and whose potential contribution remains unknown.[p.86]

>The appropriateness of the answer to the question for the audience will be reflected in the use of methods that appropriately connect one to the other, and are used by the community who form the audience for the outcome. Thus we see that for a community, certain questions are relevant, certain actions are appropriate, and certain outcomes are of interest to their concerns. These communities constitute disciplines, but also share beliefs about what they are doing and therefore inhabit the same larger academic community. Discipline boundaries are defined by identifying communities of practice that share certain interests and concerns, and expressing it in this way brings to the fore the relationship of the community to its research and knowledge base (Wenger 1999). It identifies that certain questions are meaningful, that certain methods are preferred, certain solutions are regarded as satisfying, and others are not.[p.87]

>... the hasty academicization of the creative practice community has pushed the creative practice and the academic communities together. This has caused a disruption of the internal coherence of values and actions, leading to community dissatisfaction.[p.87]

>However, the contemporary environment is changing substantially in response to the academicization of these formerly vocational subjects. At a practical level, practitioner-researchers now find themselves having been professionally trained for one type of activity but asked to perform another. The type of training that they have hitherto received regarding research has been pragmatically driven, and has consisted in their ability to find out what they need to know about a subject to enable them to operate within that subject as ‘guest workers’. However this type of research is not academic research. As we have already said, this type of research is finding out something that one does not know, whereas academic research is finding out what nobody knows.[p.88]
