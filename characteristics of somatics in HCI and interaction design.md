The audience for Loke and Schiphorst's is most likely HCI specialists. In this respect I imagine part of their work is to attempt to convince peers of the value of somatic practices and understanding to HCI. They describe how somatics privileges the "subjective, first-person perception of one's own body"[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57], and is underpinned by a sensory-motor feedback system. We pay attention to particular bodily qualities (e.g. breath, tension) and apply that awareness to habitual movement and postural patterns. 

>Many somatic practices are concerned with developing a greater awareness, articulation, and reorganization of this sensory-motor feedback system through movement and touch-based explorations.[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57]



_questions & thoughts:_

- a really useful summary of somatics written for 'lay' audience
- focus on instrumentalisation of somatic practices 
- doesn't really go into just how suspicious people are of the body (and somatics), and also how messy and painfully qualitative it is
- describes the "somatic turn" in the third-wave of HCI, and growth of first-person methodologies
