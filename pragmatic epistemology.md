>According to pragmatic epistemology, knowledge consists of models that attempt to represent the environment in such a way as maximally to simplify problem-solving. It is assumed that no model can ever hope to capture all relevant information, and even if such a complete model did exist, it would be too complicated to use in any practical way. Therefore we must accept the parallel existence of different models, even though they may seem contradictory. The model which is to be chosen depends on the problems that are to be solved. The basic criterion is that the model should produce correct (or approximate) predictions (which may be tested) or problem- solutions, and be as simple as possible. [Heylighen 1993, cited by Kleiman in @thomson_practice_2003 p.176]
