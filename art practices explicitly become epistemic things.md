# art practices explicitly become epistemic things

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

Towards the end of _The Conflict of the Faculties_, Henk Borgdorff discusses the assessment framework for artist-scholars who have submitted their work to the Journal of Artistic Research. The first element is _intent_, meaning that an artist intends their work to be research. At this point Borgdorff makes an extraordinary claim:

>By so doing, she asserts that the work is also to be regarded as research. In the context of the peer-reviewed journal, such a claim is subject to intersubjective evaluation. And something exceptional occurs here, in an epistemological and an ontological sense. The work exposed in the Research Catalogue ‘transforms’ (Latour) from an artistic product to an artistic argument, to a potential bearer of knowledge and understanding. At this moment, artworks and art practices explicitly become epistemic things (Rheinberger), exposed as research in order to set our thinking into motion.[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232]

If I understand this correctly it means that exposure in the Research Catalogue anoints the work as being an epistemic thing. Is this what he means? There is equivocation in that phrase "potential bearer", and then complete certainty in how these practices and artworks "explicitly" become epistemic things. 

"she inscribes that work, as it were, into the research discourse." -- but my experience of JAR is not this at all
"The intent criterion is captured in the all-encompassing question ‘Does the submission expose practice as research?’" - like it's just getting it out there

_questions & thoughts:_

- This seems to be like an everyday object being classified or 'viewed' as an object of art once it is displayed in a gallery. In other words, might it be possible for me to write anything that, once published in JAR, is confirmed as an epistemic thing? What are the limits here? 
- does an epistemic thing simply "set our thinking in motion"? 
- it's as if JAR is an epistemic gatekeeper
