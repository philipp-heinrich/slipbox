# epignosis and participating in knowing

_previous note:_ [[first-person experience]]

---

_Epignosis_ is a Biblical word used in the new testament that means a fuller kind of knowledge in which there is "greater participation by the 'knower' in the object 'known'."[@vines_know_1940 Câ€“2] In relation to the scriptures, it means to know something in such a way as to be more influenced by it.

_questions & thoughts:_

- obvious connection here with how we are always participating in the knowing, but particularly in practice-research
- but I'm curious about also in relation to participant-observation
