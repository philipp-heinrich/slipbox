Barker describes a scene in Tarkovsky's _Mirror_ (1975) in which the differing movements (or paths) of the camera and the actor (a boy) seem to be caused by a second actor (a therapist), as if to "exert a kinetic force on both the boy's body and camera, albeit in opposite directions".[@barker_tactile_2009 p.6]. She suggests that the viewer is destabilised or unsettled by being drawn in "two opposing directions at once"[p.6]. Barker wrestles with the idea that Tarkovsky's work here ensures that the "film's body" makes its presence known":[p.7]

>As the therapist speaks of tension, kinetic forces, bodily movements, and flowing speech, the film's body itself enacts these, leaving us to wonder whether she is addressing the boy or the film itself.[p.7] 

_questions & thoughts:_

- I am struggling with understanding the conceptualisation of _the film's body_
- what draws me to this language (or analysis) is the sense that the various bodies involved (filmic and human) are profoundly involved in how the film is felt -- its emotional or affective work
