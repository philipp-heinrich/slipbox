# greenfield, trustram and abrantes - artistic research being there

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

This is a collection of articles edited by Luisa Greenfield, Myna Trustram and Eduardo Abrantes. It comes from a series of meetings between artist-researchers from 2013 to 2015, for an itinerant organisation, the Nordic Summer University.

The full title is _Artistic Research: Being There Explorations into the Local_.

The articles are organised under three sections: 

1. Itinerant locals
2. Placing the in-between
3. Encountering a singular place

The Preface is by Roberta Mock and in it she writes how the edited volume is "utopian in spirit"[@mock_preface_2017 p.25] and seeks "what it means to be local, both as part of a collective and as an individual."[@mock_preface_2017 p.20]. For Mock the writers in the collection are "exploring place as inbetweenness; and encountering and producing space in a re-imagined form."[@mock_preface_2017 p.20]
