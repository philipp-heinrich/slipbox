# research on, for and in the arts

_previous note:_ [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts]]

---

Borgdorff distinguishes between three different types of art research: Research on the arts, research for the arts, and research in the arts. His thinking is a variant of Frayling's very early categorisation of research _into_, _for_ or _through_ art.[@frayling_research_1993]

Research on the arts has art practice as the _object_ of the research.	Borgdorff has also called this the "interpretative perspective"[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.6] and states that in this kind of research the object is "untouched"[p.6] by the researcher.

Research for the arts is _applied_ form of research in that art is "not so much the object of investigation, but its objective"[p.6] It is research that produces "insights and instruments", "the tools and the knowledge of materials" that are needed by artists. Borgdorff has also this an "instrumental perspective"[p.6]

Research in the arts "does not observe a distance between the researcher and the practice of art"[p.7]. It is where the artistic practice is a vital part of the research process and outcome.

_thoughts & links:_

- I'm drawn to this quite simple construction (although probably prefer Frayling's prepositions)
- seems unlikely that any practice-research project wouldn't include some aspect of all three (but would be curious to try and delineate them)
- #practice-research 
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
- [[art practice and artistic research]]
