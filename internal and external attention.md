# internal and external attention

_previous note:_  [[somatic turn in human computer interaction]]

---

Loke and Schiphorst refer to the body as a "qualitative set of states"[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] that is constantly changing. They describe how we have the ability to pay attention to changes in our internal state, while maintaining attention on some external activity (like interacting with technology). In doing so, they suggest that "we can utilize the shifts in internal state for the purpose of evaluating our experience of that interaction".[p.57]


_questions & thoughts:_

- they do not describe the mechanism for this _split_ process or its limitations (even though their description of [[somatic processes]] is very clear indeed)
- their focus is on extrinsic value of internal sensitivity (how can we use these skills for improving design?)
- it's difficult for me to shake how important I find intrinsic value -- of doing things for their own sake
- their perspective fails to deal with the attention-demanding power of contemporary communication technologies (like the smartphone)

--- 

_consider:_ 

- [[intrinsic value definition]]
- [[path and attention of the camera]] -- thinking here about this split between two bodies (or internal and external)
- [[device paradigm and focal things]] -- links between things that are hidden and those that are kept in awareness (like the capacity to attend in somatic sensing)
- [[the field of somatics]]
