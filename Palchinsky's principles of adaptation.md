# Palchinsky's principles of adaptation

Tim Harford is an economist, journalist and broadcaster. In _Adapt_ he describes the work and life of Russian engineer Peter Palchinsky (made known to the West by Loren Graham's 1996 book _The Ghost of the Executed Engineer: Technology and the Fall of the Soviet Union_). Harford describes Palchinsky's principles as follows:

>What Palchinsky realised was that most real-world problems are more complex than we think. They have a human dimension, a local dimension, and are likely to change as circumstances change. His method for dealing with this could be summarised as three ‘Palchinsky principles’: first, seek out new ideas and try new things; second, when trying something new, do it on a scale where failure is survivable; third, seek out feedback and learn from your mistakes as you go along.[@harford-2012-adapt Chapter 1.7 _Failure to Adapt_]

1. Seek out new ideas and try new things: variation
2. Make failure survivable: survivability
3. Seek feedback and learn as you go along: selection

_thoughts & links:_

- regarding local dimension of real-world problems see [[knowledge that is localised and fleeting]]
- related to concept of [[know-how and responsiveness]] and ability to adapt depending on specifics of local/specific situations; in other words it is often [[knowledge that is localised and fleeting]]
