# art is bad design on purpose

_previous note:_ 

---

>A work of art is a strange tool; it is an implement or instrument that has been denuded of its function. Art is the enemy of function, it is the perversion of technology. This is why architecture has a problematic standing among the arts; it is not an accident that great architects make houses with leaky roofs. And this is why, although much art concerns itself with love and erotic feeling, there is no pornographic art. Pornography has a function; it aims at something. Art, in contrast, is always the subversion of function.
>Which is not to deny that there are works of art that may as a matter of fact serve this or that function. Just as something can be a hammer and a paperweight, so something can be, literally, a urinal and a work of art, or a doorknob and an item of sculptural interest. To say that art is one thing and technology is another is not to preclude the same physical object falling into both of these categories. Indeed, it is an important fact that this is possible, for it shows that the relevant differences are not differences in the intrinsic makeup of pictures, urinals, doorknobs, or whatever. What matters is how we use them.

>Exactly the same thing can be said about pictures. The pictures in the daily newspaper or the family album strike us as self-evident and natural. It seems to us as if they are like transparencies through which we see the world. In fact, pictures, like the words of our native language, are moves or gestures in a familiar communication game. We are at home in the game and so the game seems natural. But pictures, like doorknobs, are natural only in the way that all good design is natural. Design wears the guise of nature.
This brings us to art. Design stops and art begins when we lose the possibility of taking the background of our familiar technologies for granted, when we can no longer take for granted what is, in fact, a precondition of the very natural-seeming intelligibility of such things as doorknobs and pictures. Art starts when things get strange.


>Design organizes and enables; art subverts. It does this by abrogating the background that needs to be in place for things to have their functions. You never ask, when confronted with a doorknob, What is this? For the question even to come up is for the doorknob’s utility already to have been undermined. If you even notice the knob, it’s potentially bad design.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]
>But art is bad design on purpose. It calls attention to itself. It begins precisely with this ungroundedness or absence of utility, this free fall. When you stand before a work of art, you are bound to ask, What is this? And crucially, when we are dealing with art, although there are many answers we can give to this question, there is no one answer that we can take for granted at the outset. We say what the doorknob is when we say that it is a doorknob. But we haven’t said what an artwork is if we say that it is, for example, a picture. When we ask of a work of art What is this? What is this for? we need to come up with our own answer. And so we need to take a stand, a stand, critically, on our relation to the background, on our relation to that which we normally take for granted.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]

>The case of Tony Manero brings something else to the surface: the art of dance (choreography) isn’t just more dancing (as we know it from parties, night clubs, weddings, etc.). In a way, however strange this sounds, it has nothing to do with dancing. At best the art of dance uses the familiar conventions, aims, interests, styles, attitudes, and feelings connected to dancing as a social activity and manipulates and obscures these; it makes art out of these. Choreography, in a sense, is the interruption (or subversion) of dancing. Just as, we shall see, painting is the interruption of picture making.

>The thing about art pictures—that is, representational pictures that are doing the work of art, whether painted or photographed or sculpted or digitally constructed (note: not every picture is a work of art and not every work of art, not even every painting, is or aims at being a picture)—is that they activate the puzzles whose answers are normally taken for granted. Works of art illuminate the questions, as James Baldwin is said to have put it, that are occluded by the answers we already know.

>But if you value a work of art, it is always appropriate to ask Why? If, as logicians claim, a proposition is that for which the question of truth arises, a work of art is that for which the question Why might it be valuable (or interesting)?—or simply What the heck is it?—arises!

>We are now in a position to see that this challenge that art poses—not only the challenge whether this or that work of art is any good but also whether this or that picture, or action, or object, or installation is even, in any sense, art at all—is one of art’s basic preoccupations and questions. Art is a problem for itself. Art is always, whatever else it is about, an engagement with other art, with artists, and audiences, and teachers and students. Art is, really, itself, a critical practice.
