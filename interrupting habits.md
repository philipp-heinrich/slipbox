# interrupting habits

_previous note:_  [[somatic processes]]

---

Loke and Schiphorst emphasise the role of learning by doing in somatic processes, and that observing one's self and observing others while being guided is a critical part of the process. In learning somatic processes, they describe a "continual checking-in, cross-referencing, and calibration process"[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] between the deliberate actions completed with internal awareness by the learner, and information or guidance from a teacher or guide. Such _cross-referencing_ is a feedback loop between sensation, attention, personal reflection, and the support of another person. 

Later, they describe how this mode of attention can be entered into by choice through a "process of attunement",[@loke_somatic_2018 p.57] but that this kind of attention cannot be sustained. 

_questions & thoughts:_

- thinking here about Heidegger's enframing, and imagining somatics as a method to re-enframe, to re-orient our relationship to one's own body; as if one's body is the 'technological thing' that is enframed. 
- also linking to the [[body of the film]] and the idea that we only see the "perception and expression that it makes possible, but not the body itself".[p.10 of Barker]. That in many respects somatics is a way of making the mechanisms, patterns and habits of the body transparent. talk about news flash.

- [[somatic processes]]
- [[gestell and enframing]] -- wonder here about somatics as a strategy to re-enframe
- [[body of the film]]
