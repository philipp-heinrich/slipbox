# data, experience and thinking

_previous note:_ [[direct experience through the senses]]

---

Alexander R. Galloway is a philosopher of technology. In this post he outlines the tension between thinking of _meta_ as meaning both in the middle and the frame. He suggests therefore that metadata are a problem for thinking in order to recognise and take into account this distinction between middle and frame. 

But, my particular interest here is in Galloway's simple description of the nature of data:

>Data has long been a problem for thought. Data comes from the world, after all, and it's unclear where the mind sits vis-Ã -vis the world. In a phenomenological sense, data are all the things given up to experience. Data is furnished through specific structures of cognition. Such structures are social as well as cultural. But they're also physiological, limited and conditioned by the human senses. There's no such thing as raw data, of course, but at the same time data remains fairly primitive in the phenomenological sense. Data isn't raw in the sense of unstructured, but it remains raw to the extent that it becomes the ingredients for thinking. 


_questions & thoughts:_

- simple question for me here is about perception, and what we are able to perceive when we observe complex phenomena like dance
- I love this idea of data being "all things given up to experience". That experience is the means by which data are transformed, or become useful
- thinking of #homogenous_body and wondering how this sits with operating in the mythical core of culture, in which experience might be 'pre-data'?

- [[action is the foundation of thought]]
- [[first-person experience]]
- [[weber-fechner law]]
- [[human experience and language]]
- [[empirical research]]
