Tarkovsky is writing about the image as an "impression of the truth"[@tarkovsky_sculpting_2003 p.106], "a glimpse of the truth permitted to us in our blindness"[p.106]:

>The image is indivisible and elusive, dependent upon our consciousness and on the real world which it seeks to embody.[p.106]

He suggests that humans are unable to to comprehend "the totality of the universe"[p.106] but that poetic images _are_ able to express that totality. 

_questions & thoughts:_

- thinking here about an argument for the poetic representation.
- worth searching for more work on how the image _works_. Perhaps Berger would be a simple introduction here. 
- also makes me wonder about animation project and the indivisibility of the image 
- love use of the word "embody" in how the image is acting on the "real world"
- what kind of truth is he describing?
