# touch and film

_previous note:_ 

---

In her introduction to _The Tactile Eye_, moving image scholar Jennier Barker expresses her hope that "forms of tactility"[barker_tactile_2009 p.2] are shared by the bodies of spectators and the body of film. These forms of touch are "enacted and felt"[-barker_tactile_2009 p.2] at different levels or depths of the body: the skin, the muscles and the viscera. 

The idea that touch is not solely experienced at the surface of the body through the skin is important. She describes qualities of tactility as including "tension, balance, energy, inertia, languour, velocity, rhythm" (p.2) and how these are not manifest primarily through the skin. 

My sense (although it's not clear -- at least in the introduction) is that her desire in this book is to theorise beyond an implicit criticism of film's superficiality; that not only is film tactile, but that that tactility extends beyond the surface of the skin and into the musculature and viscera of the body. Or perhaps it is that touch itself (not just tactility in film) is more than "just skin-deep but is experienced at the body's surface, in its depths, and everywhere in between."[p.2]

_questions & thoughts:_

- have there been any objections or contrary arguments to using touch as a metaphor in this way?  
- it's not clear to me the extent to which this becomes a mechanistic way of seeing the body. That is, which _direction_ is the metaphor being deployed -- from body of human to body of film, or from body of film to body of human? I would expect it is the former. Barker addresses this point in the middle of p.10 about "technological body"
- does she include _digital_ film and video?  
- it's not clear to me what is gained by thinking of film and moving image in this way
