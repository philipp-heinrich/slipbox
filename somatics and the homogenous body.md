# somatics and the homogenous body

_previous note:_  [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]

---

Ginot proposes that, for all of somatic methods' focus on the singular subjective body, they have a "backdrop" composed of a "homogenous, universal, ahistorical, and occidental body."[@ginot_shustermans_2010 p.23] She suggests that there is an _essentialist_ idea of the body in somatics as being "natural and organic"[p.23] that re-centres itself irrespective of how much somatics focuses on plasticity, difference and change. The rationale for the power of this essentialism is that even though somatics is clearly underpinned by non-Western principles and practices, none of this "borrowing"[p.23] affects the "homogeneity of the body produced by somatics because the main purpose is to take care of or heal a Western body, a victim of its own culture."[p.23]


_questions & thoughts:_

- something about taking care of the Western body in relation to how somatics might extend out into the world (Ginot makes the distinction between different types of somatic practices, e.g. CI which is relational). In tension with hyper-individualism.
