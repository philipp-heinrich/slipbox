# schwab - towards an artistic epistemology 

_previous note:_ 

---

In this article Michael Schwab proposes "a post-conceptual understanding of experimental systems as the foundation for an artistic epistemology."[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.129] He draws on the work of science historian Hans-Jörg Rheinberger, sociologist Steven Shapin, and art historian Herbert Molderings' analysis of Duchamp. His reading of Molderings in particular is very close, and includes a brief history and development of the concept of experimentation in art.

## artistic epistemology and radical individuality

>it is less helpful to decide whether any concrete epistemic thing is fact or fiction; rather, an artistic epistemology is suggested that focuses on the radical individuality of such a thing and the way in which artistic research practice may need to protect its individuality as a site for particular knowledges.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.120]

>Thus, an artistic epistemology needs to reject notions of ‘truth’ to which artistic practice is subservient. At the same time, it needs to support artistic modes of identifying certain unique, material things as true, in the sense that they can be witnessed as epistemically relevant despite their unknown status, in other words, as a matter of fact. This can only happen on a case-by-case basis where the experimental system both produces and protects its epistemic thing as a unique being. However, given the rejection of ‘truth’, such protection cannot displace the epistemic thing into either negativity or concealment; rather, meaning needs to remain materially accessible.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.129] 

- individuality from what? or compared with what? 

## experimentation is social

>Only the combination of matter and discourse gives experimentation its own distinct identity in the field of knowledge. This makes experimentation not only an epistemic project but also, as Shapin argues, deeply social.[pp.121-122] 
>Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (1997) calls such a combination of matter and discourse  ‘experimental system’. Experimental systems are complex apparatuses for the production of knowledge.[p.122]

>The social dimension of experimentation stems from the agreement that has to be reached whereby a particular something resulting from the experimental system is, in fact, matter-of-fact. This something as matter-of-fact does not strictly speaking exist before such (public) negotiation, making an epistemic thing not only a piece of knowledge but also an ‘artefact of communication’ (Shapin 1984, 484).[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123]

>Both the communicative and the material role of replication allow for a slippage from concrete experiment to universal theory: if a large and diverse group of people believes something to be a matter of fact in a number of different experiments, can we not assume it to be a matter of fact in all possible cases and for all possible witnesses?[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123]

- no you cannot assume this. Should be seeking cases where it is not believed (dealing here with falsifiability)

>Through experimental systems, we have the ability to create matters of fact, which we paradoxically believe have been there all along. In other words, it appears as if my knowledge of the world is a reflection of the world as it is and not an elaborate coproduction. Suggesting this kind of agency, however, does not mean that the knowledge we end up with is a cultural construct; it only means that epistemic things lacking identity are strange natural/cultural ‘hybrids’ (Latour 1993) or ‘proto-objects’ (Schwab 2012), which, once they ‘decay’ into knowledge, become associated with either nature or culture as something ‘found’ or ‘made’.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]

- what of the senses? what might actually be there? How to untangle this construction? 

## epistemic things are vague
"unexpected new objects relevant to knowledge emerge"[p.122] -- what are such 'new objects'?  Read on -- he clarifies when he discusses Rheinberger's "technical objects"

>but for Rheinberger, despite being matter of fact, an epistemic thing is essentially vague. ‘This vagueness is inevitable because, paradoxically, epistemic things embody what one does not yet know’ (Rheinberger 1997, 28). Being conceptually underdetermined represents a strength rather than a weakness, because epistemic things are first of all questions that promise a future (of possible knowledge). The practice of experimentation thus also repositions theory: theory emerges from experimentation rather than being tested by it. Rheinberger calls the experimental mode by which epistemic things emerge ‘thinking’ (Rheinberger 1997, 31). However, the moment epistemic things become conceptually stable, they move into the technological fabric of the experimental system – they become ‘technical objects’ ready to be used in the same or future experimental systems or turned into commodities for the benefit of those with investment in the experimental system.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]

- emergence of theory is key here. But, the problem (as I see it) in PaR is that we extend (beyond belief) what communities of (theoretical) practice we can conceivably be in dialogue with.
- there is also danger here that Rheinberger's thinking becomes a way to make a virtue out of the necessity of vagueness in PaR. And in the history of PaR has anything ever become conceptually stable? (perhaps forms of documentation?). I think I need to understand more clearly the experimental process as Rheinberger describes it (and its value at different stages). Schwab is valorising vagueness -- which is fab -- but where does that get us? 


## epistemic things, technical objects and Duchamp


## virtual witnessing

>In addition, perhaps the most radical extension of a witnessing public happens when a matter of fact is accepted on the basis of mere description and not direct observation, which Shapin calls ‘virtual witnessing’ (Shapin 1984, 490). To witness, it is claimed, does not require presence, since according to Shapin (1984, 491) ‘we should also appreciate that the text itself constitutes a visual source’. On the most basic level, the insertion of illustrations into the text provides visuality, in particular if images are naturalistic, creating the impression of seeing a document and thus a trace of the actual experiment. Moreover, visuality can also be part of the language itself since it can allow an experiment to be ‘seen’ in one’s imagination. Thus, visuality can be scattered across all the different building blocks of a text. This turns the mind into a form of laboratory where understanding what to do can replace actually doing it, apparently without much epistemic loss.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123] 

- paragraph about virtual witnessing (make own note from it): seems to relate to experimenting with documentation in relation to authentic movement #finger-pointing-moon; continues this discussion (about virtual witness -- slightly more clearly) on p.124
