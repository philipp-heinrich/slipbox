# schwab - towards an artistic epistemology 

_previous note:_ 

---

>the article argues that it is less helpful to decide whether any concrete epistemic thing is fact or fiction; rather, an artistic epistemology is suggested that focuses on the radical individuality of such a thing and the way in which artistic research practice may need to protect its individuality as a site for particular knowledges.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.120]

- individuality from what? or compared with what? 

>Only the combination of matter and discourse gives experimentation its own distinct identity in the field of knowledge. This makes experimentation not only an epistemic project but also, as Shapin argues,  deeply social.[pp.121-122] 
>Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (1997) calls such a combination of matter and discourse  ‘experimental system’. Experimental systems are complex apparatuses for the production of knowledge.[p.122]

>Crucially, an experimental system ‘plays out its own intrinsic capacities’ the more the experimenter ‘learns to handle his or her experimental system’ (Rheinberger 1997, 24) until it is able to surprise the experimenter with its own characteristics,  unanticipated by the system’s creator, in what Rheinberger calls ‘unprecedented events’ (Rheinberger 1997, 133).[p.122]

"deployed knowledge"[p.122] -- not clear what MS means by this term

"unexpected new objects relevant to knowledge emerge"[p.122] -- what are such 'new objects'?  Read on -- he clarifies when he discusses Rheinberger's "technical objects"

>but for Rheinberger, despite being matter of fact, an epistemic thing is essentially vague. ‘This vagueness is inevitable because, paradoxically, epistemic things embody what one does not yet know’ (Rheinberger 1997, 28). Being conceptually underdetermined represents a strength rather than a weakness, because epistemic things are first of all questions that promise a future (of possible knowledge). The practice of experimentation thus also repositions theory: theory emerges from experimentation rather than being tested by it. Rheinberger calls the experimental mode by which epistemic things emerge ‘thinking’ (Rheinberger 1997, 31). However, the moment epistemic things become conceptually stable, they move into the technological fabric of the experimental system – they become ‘technical objects’ ready to be used in the same or future experimental systems or turned into commodities for the benefit of those with investment in the experimental system.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]

- emergence of theory is key here. But, the problem (as I see it) in PaR is that we extend (beyond belief) what communities of (theoretical) practice we can conceivably be in dialogue with.
- there is also danger here that Rheinberger's thinking becomes a way to make a virtue out of the necessity of vagueness in PaR. And in the history of PaR has anything ever become conceptually stable? (perhaps forms of documentation?). I think I need to understand more clearly the experimental process as Rheinberger describes it (and its value at different stages). Schwab is valorising vagueness -- which is fab -- but where does that get us? 

>Through experimental systems, we have the ability to create matters of fact, which we paradoxically believe have been there all along. In other words, it appears as if my knowledge of the world is a reflection of the world as it is and not an elaborate coproduction. Suggesting this kind of agency, however, does not mean that the knowledge we end up with is a cultural construct; it only means that epistemic things lacking identity are strange natural/cultural ‘hybrids’ (Latour 1993) or ‘proto-objects’ (Schwab 2012), which, once they ‘decay’ into knowledge, become associated with either nature or culture as something ‘found’ or ‘made’.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]

- what of the senses? what might actually be there? How to untangle this construction? 

>The social dimension of experimentation stems from the agreement that has to be reached whereby a particular something resulting from the experimental system is, in fact, matter-of-fact. This something as matter-of-fact does not strictly speaking exist before such (public) negotiation, making an epistemic thing not only a piece of knowledge but also an ‘artefact of communication’ (Shapin 1984, 484).[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123]

- paragraph about virtual witnessing (make own note from it): seems to relate to experimenting with documentation in relation to authentic movement #finger-pointing-moon; continues this discussion (about virtual witness -- slightly more clearly) on p.124
- use of Duchamp to explain idea of epistemic thing is very useful (and worth adding as atomic note linked to [[epistemic things and technical objects]])
