# schwab - towards an artistic epistemology 

_previous note:_ 

---

>the article argues that it is less helpful to decide whether any concrete epistemic thing is fact or fiction; rather, an artistic epistemology is suggested that focuses on the radical individuality of such a thing and the way in which artistic research practice may need to protect its individuality as a site for particular knowledges.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.120]

- individuality from what? or compared with what? 

>Only the combination of matter and discourse gives experimentation its own distinct identity in the field of knowledge. This makes experimentation not only an epistemic project but also, as Shapin argues,  deeply social.[pp.121-122] 
>Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (1997) calls such a combination of matter and discourse  ‘experimental system’. Experimental systems are complex apparatuses for the production of knowledge.[p.122]

>Crucially, an experimental system ‘plays out its own intrinsic capacities’ the more the experimenter ‘learns to handle his or her experimental system’ (Rheinberger 1997, 24) until it is able to surprise the experimenter with its own characteristics,  unanticipated by the system’s creator, in what Rheinberger calls ‘unprecedented events’ (Rheinberger 1997, 133).[p.122]

"deployed knowledge"[p.122] -- not clear what MS means by this term
