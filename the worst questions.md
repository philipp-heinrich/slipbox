# the worst questions

_previous note:_ [[listening and curiosity]]

---


Murphy discusses the listening skills and work of sociologist Howard Becker who spent long periods of time (months, years) being with various sub-cultures like jazz musicians, actors, medical students. Becker says, "I’m not sure I’m a better listener than anyone else, but if I hear something I don’t understand, I ask about it."[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 12, n.p.]

According to Murphy, for Becker, the "worst questions are the ones that are never asked."[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 12, n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- I'd love to develop a list of the questions I never asked (and deal with why I never asked them)
- this relates to [[assumptions of uniformity]] and what questions are allowed, and which are not

_consider:_

- [[conversational expectations]]
- [[closeness-communication bias]]
